"""
The grammar parses without an Earley ambiguity (.agents/STACK.md).
Programs Hypothesis derives from the grammar reach the corners no
example was written for; they are drawn from the grammar with its blocks
flattened, since an indenter cannot run inside a derivation (HOLES.md:
ambiguity-over-flat). The corpus is pre-lexed and read by Earley over
the whole grammar with the tab indenter, which keeps every derivation it
finds.
