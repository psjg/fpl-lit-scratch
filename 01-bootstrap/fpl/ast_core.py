"""
The core AST: what desugaring leaves and evaluation reads.

A program is statements: a definition, or a line run on a fresh stack.
Code is a tuple of nodes, each a push of a value, a call of a word, a
binder over the code in its scope, or a dict built from its values. A
value is a number, a string, a strand of those, a ⟨ ⟩ list, a quotation,
a symbol or a dict; a section is a quotation. EFFECTS declares each
builtin's effect, the same data an effect line gives a defined word; a
word that runs a quotation declares a fixed effect whatever the
quotation does (hole control-effects); ? and _ declare none, the
elaborator finding what fills them (hole goal-placeholder).
