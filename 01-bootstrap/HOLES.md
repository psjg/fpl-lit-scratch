# HOLES.md

Where the documents are silent: what depends on it, the default in force, who closes it and how.
A hole is closed by the commit that removes its entry; that commit's body names it.

    ## <hole-name>
    - Depends on it: <paths, examples, tests>
    - Default in force: <behaviour now; the mechanism it reuses>
    - Closes by: <whom>, <how>
    - Evidence: <file:line | SHAR section | claim id>

## claims-source
- Depends on it: the claims lens, every step-3 implementer, the coverage matrix
- Default in force: the Drafts have no tables; a claim is a Draft 1-4 code line carrying a trailing ; comment (43 claims, ids D<draft>.<n>), its part set by keyword family, else the ;;; section, else 02-stack (3 rows)
- Closes by: PSJ and palimpsest, taking or refusing Caesura's proposal as the candidate close: a claim is a trailing comment that begins '; →', an expected result (10 in the corpus, 11 once Draft 1's '; 0 3 5 6 / …' is respelled); else a claims table
- Evidence: the session's design/INDEX.md (0 table lines in design/draft-1.md to design/draft-4.md); design/claims.jsonl sha256 62c3c94e

## parser-algorithm
- Depends on it: fpl/parse.py, tests/test_parse.py, tests/test_ambiguity.py, every features example
- Default in force: LALR over fpl/grammar.lark with the tab indenter as postlex (linear, no backtracking); the pre-lexer counts strings and block comments; .agents/STACK.md:27 still names Earley
- Closes by: maintainer, a root docs change settling LALR in .agents/STACK.md, or a request for Earley
- Evidence: .agents/STACK.md:27; handoff/SHAR-syntax.org:122 "The grammar"; SHAR gram/test_fpl.py:5-16 and the parser line after islands()

## ambiguity-over-flat
- Depends on it: tests/test_ambiguity.py ("programs derived from the grammar parse without ambiguity"), tests/test_print.py (the flat law)
- Default in force: from_lark draws from the block-free FLAT grammar (declared _INDENT/_DEDENT have no pattern to generate from), parsed by Earley ambiguity='explicit' lexer='basic'; the corpus is read by Earley with the tab indenter over the whole grammar; blocks are covered by the corpus and the printer's tree strategy only
- Closes by: implementer, a generator emitting indented blocks (a derivation that emits _INDENT and _DEDENT, rendered as tabs); or maintainer accepts
- Evidence: handoff/SHAR-syntax.org:486 printer.py docstring, its FLAT replace() for _NL and LCOMMENT match nothing in fpl.lark; after 8a753ec no _ambig in 2000 flat draws nor in the 29 pre-lexed examples, before it 1814 of 2000 and 26 of 29 (8a753ec's body)

## grammar-departs-from-handoff
- Depends on it: fpl/grammar.lark, every example
- Default in force: PSJ's decisions of 2026-09-29: the hand-off's one frame rule (frames: frame (_BAR frame)*, a frame may be empty) for lines and enclosures; an enclosure takes frames without ?, so [] ⟨⟩ () {} are one empty frame (bars + 1 frames, the base case, distinct from [ | ]); start: line* without _NL*, so an empty line is only the first line of a file that opens blank; comments are NOTE and DOC tokens on their line (line: frames (NOTE | DOC)? _NL block?), no longer ignored, and _NL is the hand-off's blank run again, whose lines but the last may hold tabs, spaces and form feeds (form-feed-line)
- Closes by: Caesura (syntax author), folding these decisions into the hand-off's grammar and its prose
- Evidence: 61399de fix(grammar): keep comments as tokens and read [] as one empty frame; session grammar-fix/proof2.log (LALR no conflicts, 29/29 examples, Earley _ambig 0/29 and 0/2000 flat draws); earlier 8a753ec; proof3.log after bd41245, the same counts

## grammar-comment-word
- Depends on it: fpl/grammar.lark:15
- Default in force: the grammar is kept to the hand-off's wording, including one filler word ('simply') in a comment
- Closes by: Caesura, rewording in the hand-off; the grammar follows
- Evidence: fpl/grammar.lark:15; handoff/SHAR-syntax.org:122 "The grammar"

## string-self-delimits
- Depends on it: fpl/lex.py (_pair), fpl/parse.py (item), tests/test_parse.py
- Default in force: a string's placeholder is its own token, found by its code offset, as every other enclosure self-delimits; a sigil before a string is a word of its own
- Closes by: design, by saying whether $“x” or #“x” carries a prefix
- Evidence: SHAR gram/test_fpl.py:98-103 (shape: kind string when the body starts with ¶); fpl/grammar.lark layer (1) comment

## comments-hide-pairs
- Depends on it: fpl/lex.py (_special, _brackets), tests/test_parse.py
- Default in force: a ; or ⍝ line comment is copied through untouched: quotes and brackets in it are not counted, as the grammar's LCOMMENT swallows them
- Closes by: design, by confirming a line comment is opaque to the pre-lexer
- Evidence: SHAR gram/test_fpl.py:18-38 and :40-67 count inside comments; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/04-4-list-patterns.fpl:16

## block-comment-at-line-start
- Depends on it: fpl/lex.py (_pair)
- Default in force: a ⟦ ⟧ comment opening a line leaves the line's tabs and drops the spaces after it; mid-line it becomes one space
- Closes by: design, by saying what indentation a line opened by a block comment has
- Evidence: SHAR gram/test_fpl.py:25-26 strips the leading tabs too

## final-newline
- Depends on it: fpl/lex.py (prelex), fpl/print.py
- Default in force: the pre-lexer ends the code with a newline, so a source or island need not end in one; the printer always writes one
- Closes by: design, or the printer, which normalises
- Evidence: SHAR gram/test_fpl.py islands() appends '\n' to an island; grammar line: frames _NL

## modifier-inside-word
- Depends on it: fpl/lex.py (shape), fpl/parse.py (word)
- Default in force: a modifier anywhere but at the end of a token is refused: "a modifier ends its word: <token>"
- Closes by: design
- Evidence: SHAR gram/test_fpl.py shape() asserts the match

## arrow-spelling
- Depends on it: fpl/lex.py (SHAPE)
- Default in force: the prefix -> (name spelling) is read beside → (glyph), each kept as written
- Closes by: design, with the name-spelling table
- Evidence: SHAR SHAPE has → only; shared decision (f) "->x (→x) is mortal"

## trailing-comment-glued
- Depends on it: fpl/grammar.lark (TOKEN, NOTE), fpl/parse.py (_Build.comment), fpl/print.py (comment)
- Default in force: ; self-delimits, as the grammar's TOKEN excludes it, so x; note is the word x and a note on its line, also when glued; the printer sets the note apart in a cell of its own (x\t; note)
- Closes by: design, confirming that ; needs no whitespace before it
- Evidence: SHAR gram/test_fpl.py:265 requires whitespace before ;; fpl/grammar.lark TOKEN (x; note)

## empty-node-span
- Depends on it: fpl/parse.py (_Build.at)
- Default in force: a frame that matched no token (one beside a bar, | x, or the one frame of an empty enclosure, []) starts where its enclosing node does; an empty first line starts at the newline that ends it
- Closes by: the printer's round trip, when it needs a finer position
- Evidence: fpl/parse.py _Build.at (tree.meta.empty); Span is field(compare=False) in fpl/ast_surface.py, so the round trip does not see it

## nesting-depth
- Depends on it: fpl/parse.py (parse, _Build is recursive), tests/test_parse.py::test_nesting_too_deep_to_read_is_refused
- Default in force: nesting that exhausts Python's recursion limit (about 100 brackets or ⟨ ⟩ islands, a few hundred block levels) is one error, ERROR: 1:1 nesting too deep to read; it reuses the FplError every refusal is
- Closes by: an implementer, by an iterative build that reads any depth, or design, by naming a depth limit and where it is reported
- Evidence: fpl/parse.py _Build.item -> subtrees -> frames -> frame; RecursionError at 100 nested [ and at 400 block levels before the refusal

## stray-closer-refused
- Depends on it: fpl/lex.py (_special, _brackets), tests/test_parse.py::test_a_refusal_is_one_error_line
- Default in force: a closer with no opener (] ” 」 ⟧) or one that does not close the latest opener is refused where it stands, as an unclosed opener is; SHAR passes a stray bracket closer to Lark and a stray pair closer through as text
- Closes by: design, by confirming that every closer must balance
- Evidence: SHAR gram/test_fpl.py:34 (elif ch in CLOSE and stack: stack.pop()), :45-46 (only openers are special)

## snippet-split
- Depends on it: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/{draft1,draft2,draft3,server,sketch,match}/examples/*.fpl; tests/test_conformance.py::test_example[*]; tests/test_ambiguity.py::test_no_ambiguity_in_the_corpus[*]
- Default in force: one .fpl per snippet set, cut at ;;; lines where the section parses alone, else joined to the part before (draft1, draft3 and server stay whole; draft2 is split 11 ways, sketch 7, match 7); the parts are byte copies of the tangled hand-off and concatenate to the snippet byte for byte
- Closes by: maintainer or design side, re-cutting the fixtures or confirming the rule
- Evidence: decision (b); the fixture commits 42a7b7c, f30b1ef, e04a708, b75ee2f, 4b8213b, 3302d19, each section parsing alone; handoff/SHAR-syntax.org:828 "The snippet corpus"

## program-output
- Depends on it: fpl/driver.py, fpl/desugar.py listing, tests/test_desugar.py, every .expected that is not an error line
- Default in force: each top-level line that is not a definition runs on a fresh stack and prints one line, the stack it leaves as fpl/print.py writes the items that push it, with a bar between two literals that would otherwise strand; a definition prints nothing; a program with no line to run prints nothing. A section prints in the printer's spelling, [ 1 2 3 + ] for the Draft's [1‿2‿3 +]
- Closes by: design side, a Draft statement of what a program prints
- Evidence: decision (d); draft2 §frames, 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/01-frames.fpl:2-4 (one result per line; line 3 has nothing below after line 2 left 2 3 4); claims D2.1-D2.3

## expected-evolution
- Depends on it: every 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/*/examples/*.expected (28, _template aside); tests/test_conformance.py::test_example[*]; tests/test_main.py::test_a_file_that_cannot_run_prints_one_error_line
- Default in force: every .expected starts as the one line ERROR: 1:1 no evaluator yet; a step-3 PR replaces one in its own [spec] commit with a value transcribed from the example's trailing ; comments or a Draft claim, source lines named, never from the implementation's output; the maintainer did not write these values
- Closes by: maintainer, reviewing each [spec] commit; each step-3 PR closes it per example
- Evidence: decisions (b) and (c); AGENTS.md "The oracle rule"; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/*/examples/*.expected at 3302d197

## unimplemented-words
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py unimplemented; the 23 of 28 examples still at ERROR: 1:1 no evaluator yet, each named with the first thing desugar refuses: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft1/examples/draft1.fpl (newline), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/03-operatives-thunks.fpl (debug), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/04-effects-holes-ascription.fpl (shape), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/05-the-dictionary-is.fpl (words), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/06-constructors-run-backwards.fpl (unpair), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/08-objects-are-directories.fpl (dict), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/10-quasiquote-inside.fpl ($q, an unquote), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/11-laziness.fpl (curry), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft3/examples/paths.fpl (shape), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/01-1-constructors-run.fpl (pos), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/02-2-the-same.fpl (a pattern on the effect line), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/03-3-multiple-dispatch.fpl (Asteroid), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/04-4-list-patterns.fpl (false), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/05-5-prolog-s-family.fpl (x in mother's body), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/06-6-python-s-keywords.fpl (a record pattern on the effect line), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/server/examples/server.fpl (+in/data on the effect line), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/sketch/examples/05-5-multiple-dispatch.fpl (shape/r), and 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/sketch/examples/01, 02, 03, 04, 06 and 07 (seam ∈ … in a directory, no definition nor bind)
- Default in force: desugar refuses, before anything runs, all but: decimal numbers, strings without islands, [ ], ( ) of one cell, ⟨ ⟩ of literals, bars, tabs, blocks, name : ins -- outs definitions (each slot a name or name: Type), →x and ->x of a plain name or a path, #name symbols, { } of plain keys each with one item pushing one value, name/ heads with a block of definitions, subdirectories and #name bind lines, paths a/b and ../x that name a defined word, w/history, w/doc, w/effect, a match line with its block of rows in a definition's body, clauses of one word whose typed inputs cross only where their meet is a clause or two builtin type words make them disjoint, and the words of fpl/ast_core.py EFFECTS (+ - times swap dup drop enclose , pair cons ! if swap-args repeat each scan fold, and ? and _ in a term), with ERROR: 1:1 no evaluator yet (the skeleton's message and position, reused); but a call that no definition or builtin answers is refused at its word, as `unknown word: w` or, for a directory or a word of PLANNED (fpl/ast_core.py, the words the examples call), `no evaluator yet: w`, and tests/test_conformance.py keeps the skeleton's line for the 13 examples whose `.expected` holds it, until they are rewritten
- Closes by: each step-3 part, shrinking the set
- Evidence: fpl/driver.py (skeleton); fpl/ast_core.py EFFECTS; each example run through fpl.driver.run at 203e0ba, the refusal traced to its caller in fpl/desugar.py (resolve, origin, effect_line, mount)

## doc-absent
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py (Catalog.enter, DOC), fpl/eval.py (evaluate), tests/test_comments.py, 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft3/examples/paths.fpl:10
- Default in force: every word w has w/doc, as it has w/history; the doc goes with the definition in force (Define.doc), so a word with no doc, or shadowed by a definition with none, pushes the empty string
- Closes by: design, saying what an undocumented word's doc is (a refusal, the empty string, or no such word)
- Evidence: claim D3.2 (draft-3.md:13); paths.fpl:10 asks math/mean/doc of a mean with no ;; line

## doc-text
- Depends on it: fpl/trivia.py (docstrings, _aimed), tests/test_trivia.py, tests/test_comments.py
- Default in force: a ;; is a doc when the next code line is a head (winning over a body it opens), or when it opens a head's body before any of its code, as SHAR comments() reads it; else it is before the next code line; a head is a line whose first cell's second item is the plain word :; a docstring is each doc's text, marks and the whitespace around it dropped, those above the head first, joined by newlines; ;;; and ;;;; stay bound to their level wherever they stand (hole comment-levels), where the SHAR reads them at column 0 only
- Closes by: design, fixing a docstring's text and whether both places may hold one
- Evidence: SHAR gram/test_fpl.py:255-281; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/04-effects-holes-ascription.fpl:3

## fresh-unify-space
- Depends on it: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match (Prolog's family), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/sketch (logic tree)
- Default in force: not implemented; a program using fresh, unify or space reports ERROR: 1:1 no evaluator yet
- Closes by: maintainer, scheduling two-way unification
- Evidence: campaign scope, step 3

## goal-placeholder
- Depends on it: fpl/types.py filled, wanted, reported; fpl/driver.py run; fpl/__main__.py; fpl/eval.py unfilled; tests/test_types.py test_a_goal_is_reported_with_the_effect_that_fills_it, test_a_goal_run_is_refused_where_it_stands; tests/test_main.py test_a_goal_goes_to_stderr_before_the_program_runs; tests/test_match.py test_a_wildcard_row_whose_body_is_a_goal_is_reported
- Default in force: ? is a word of no fixed effect (a Call, no core node; desugar balances it as taking and leaving nothing); elaboration reports it as data, GOAL <line>:<col> ? : <ins> -- <outs>, the driver handing each line to a reporter the command line points at stderr, before any line runs; the goal takes the whole stack under it and leaves what the code after it takes, or, when nothing follows, what the effect line promises (none on a top-level line); an input of the body prints as t and its index, a sort as its name; elaboration goes on with values of no known sort; running it is ERROR: <line>:<col> unfilled goal; a goal under a control word, in a quotation or a { } value, or in a body a control word leaves untyped is not reported
- Closes by: design side, the report's form and destination and a goal's extent (the whole stack, or what it is ascribed)
- Evidence: handoff/SHAR-syntax.org:906 and :1016 (S40); claims D2.7 (03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/04-effects-holes-ascription.fpl:5, grade and pick not builtins, so it cannot evaluate yet) and D4.3, 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/01-1-constructors-run.fpl:15

## print-obligation-unlisted
- Depends on it: tests/test_print.py, .harness/scripts/props
- Default in force: the tree law is marked @pytest.mark.obligation("print then parse is the identity"), but .harness/quality/obligations.toml lists no printer obligation, so .harness/scripts/props does not enforce it
- Closes by: a root [policy] commit adding [fpl.print] to .harness/quality/obligations.toml
- Evidence: .harness/quality/obligations.toml ("Owed once there is a printer")

## eval-obligation-unlisted
- Depends on it: tests/test_match.py test_the_row_chosen_is_the_first_whose_patterns_match and test_a_match_is_exhaustive_exactly_when_its_effect_has_no_fail, .harness/scripts/props
- Default in force: the two properties are marked @pytest.mark.obligation("the row chosen is the first whose patterns match") and @pytest.mark.obligation("a match is exhaustive exactly when its effect has no +fail"), and the file imports fpl.eval and fpl.desugar so .harness/scripts/props credits both; .harness/quality/obligations.toml lists neither, so .harness/scripts/props does not enforce them (as print-obligation-unlisted)
- Closes by: a root [policy] commit adding the first to [fpl.eval] (matching) and the second to [fpl.desugar] (fallible, catches) in .harness/quality/obligations.toml
- Evidence: .harness/quality/obligations.toml (no [fpl.eval] table; [fpl.desugar] lists one obligation); campaign scope 06-match ("Property: the row chosen is the first whose patterns match. Property: exhaustive ⇔ no +fail.")





## fon-unwritable
- Depends on it: fpl/fon.py (write, embed), tests/test_fon.py::test_json_embeds_and_reads_back
- Default in force: a text holding an unbalanced “ or 「, or a symbol that spells another kind (1, #a, true), has no FON spelling; write gives the text as is and read refuses it or reads another value; the JSON property draws texts without “ and ”; a JSON key that is not a plain symbol is kept as text
- Closes by: design, an escape in strings or a statement that such values are outside the profile
- Evidence: handoff/SHAR-syntax.org:621 "FON-data" (no escape; its strategy filters balanced quotes)

## comment-levels
- Depends on it: fpl/grammar.lark (NOTE, DOC), fpl/parse.py (_Build.comment), fpl/print.py (comment), fpl/trivia.py
- Default in force: PSJ's decisions of 2026-09-29: the level is bound to position, as in Lisp. ; (and ⍝, which counts as ;) is a note after the code of its line, continued by the ; lines right under it, one token with them; a blank line ends a note; ;; ;;; ;;;; stand on a line of their own: ;; the doc of the next code line, ;;; a section, ;;;; the file; ;; or deeper after code is refused at the comment
- Closes by: Caesura, folding the rule into the hand-off's grammar prose
- Evidence: session grammar-fix/proof2.log; tests/test_parse.py::test_a_comment_is_held_by_its_line, tests/test_trivia.py

## comment-levels-vs-corpus
- Depends on it: fpl/parse.py (_Build.comment), 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples
- Default in force: a ; with no code before it that continues no note is kept as a note line (one empty frame and its note), not refused as the rule says, because the corpus has four: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/04-4-list-patterns.fpl:15-16, 07-7-abc-s-keywords.fpl:2-3; no ;; is after code
- Closes by: PSJ or Caesura rewriting those lines (as ;; or as notes after code); then the builder refuses the standalone ;
- Evidence: session grammar-fix/measure.log, proof2.log

## note-alignment
- Depends on it: fpl/parse.py (_Build.comment), fpl/print.py (_Out.column, comment)
- Default in force: PSJ's decision of 2026-09-29: a continuation line of a note carries as many tabs before its ; as the code line has before its own ; (elastic tabstops), and a continued note stands in its own cell; the printer sets every note in its own cell and aligns its continuations; the builder does not refuse a misaligned continuation, since the corpus has two: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/03-3-multiple-dispatch.fpl:8 (1 tab, note at 5), 06-6-python-s-keywords.fpl:6 (0 tabs, note at 1)
- Closes by: Caesura folding the rule into the hand-off; PSJ or Caesura realigning those lines; then the builder refuses with "a continued note aligns with the note above: N tabs"
- Evidence: session grammar-fix/proof2.log (note alignment section)

## comment-heads-block
- Depends on it: fpl/grammar.lark (line), fpl/desugar.py (coded)
- Default in force: a comment line may head an indented block (an outline heading); no example has one; desugar refuses such a line as unimplemented (no evaluator yet), since running its block as quotations or as lines is undecided; a comment line with no block is no statement
- Closes by: Caesura, confirming or refusing it
- Evidence: session grammar-fix/proof2.log (";;; s\n\ta" parses once, 0 heads in the corpus)

## comment-in-enclosure
- Depends on it: fpl/parse.py (_tree)
- Default in force: a comment inside a multi-line enclosure is refused, ERROR: a comment cannot stand inside an enclosure; no example has one
- Closes by: Caesura, giving comments a place inside enclosures if one is wanted
- Evidence: session grammar-fix/proof2.log (0 comments inside an enclosure in the corpus); tests/test_parse.py::test_a_refusal_is_one_error_line

## empty-first-line
- Depends on it: fpl/grammar.lark (start), fpl/print.py (render), fpl/desugar.py (coded)
- Default in force: a file that opens with blank lines has one empty first line, and "\n\tx" gives that line a block; a blank source ("", "\n") is that one line and prints as the empty text; no example opens blank (PSJ: leading blank lines are not useful, a refusal is acceptable)
- Closes by: PSJ or Caesura, keeping it or refusing a blank first line; until then desugar runs nothing for it, and refuses it as unimplemented when it heads a block
- Evidence: session grammar-fix/proof2.log; tests/test_parse.py::test_only_the_first_line_is_empty_and_it_may_hold_a_block

## form-feed-line
- Depends on it: fpl/grammar.lark (_NL), tests/test_print.py::test_a_blank_line_is_part_of_its_blank_run_whatever_it_holds
- Default in force: a form feed is the page separator, ignored like a space; a line holding only tabs, spaces and form feeds inside a blank run is part of the run, so it leaves no line and prints as nothing; only the last line's tabs are indentation, so a form feed before a line's tabs leaves it at depth 0 as before
- Closes by: Caesura or PSJ, confirming the form feed as a page separator, or refusing it outside strings and comments
- Evidence: bd41245 fix(grammar): read a line of form feeds as part of its blank run; session grammar-fix/proof3.log, ffcheck.log

## saturation-balance
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py _Desugar.body, tests/test_desugar.py (D2.1-D2.3, D2.5, D2.6, D1.5)
- Default in force: arity is balanced statically in desugar: a top-level line starts at 0; the bar carries the balance on; a : body starts at the effect line's inputs and runs on from line to line (one stack); a block's children come before their head, each saturated as a frame is (a value child adds what its code leaves, a quotation child one); quotation bodies are code and never checked; a frame whose words reach below its starting balance is a section, the whole frame pushed as one quotation, never an error
- Closes by: design side, a Draft rule for where a section starts (the whole frame, or from the word that underflows) and for body lines
- Evidence: decision (f); claims D2.1-D2.3 (draft2 §frames), D2.5 (curry's body underflows its frame but not its effect line)

## effect-line-trusted
- Depends on it: fpl/types.py inferred, declared, agreed; fpl/desugar.py arity; fpl/eval.py builtin; tests/test_binders.py and tests/test_desugar.py reaching a runtime underflow through [ ] !; tests/test_types.py test_match_rows_leaving_different_counts_keep_the_effect_line
- Default in force: a body is inferred and its count checked against its effect line at the definition (fpl/types.py), a match's rows each typed, their pattern names of no known sort; a body with a control word (! if swap-args repeat each scan fold), or a match whose rows leave different counts, is not inferred and its effect line is trusted, a shortfall refused later at the word that finds too few
- Closes by: fpl/types.py, once control words take their quotation's arrow (hole control-effects); design, whether rows leaving different counts are an error
- Evidence: fpl/types.py; tests/test_types.py test_a_body_is_checked_against_its_effect_line

## definition-scope
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py desugar, fpl/eval.py evaluate, tests/test_desugar.py test_lcurry_puts_a_swap_between
- Default in force: definitions are global to the program; a word may be used above its definition; a later definition of a name shadows an earlier one for every line, builtins included
- Closes by: design side, with bind's ordered log (decision f) once 03-binders lands
- Evidence: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/02-currying.fpl:4-5 (lcurry uses curry); decision (f) "later shadows earlier"

## pervasive-arithmetic
- Depends on it: fpl/eval.py arithmetic, tests/test_desugar.py
- Default in force: + - times take numbers or strands of numbers; a number meets each item of a strand, two strands meet item by item; unequal lengths and non-numbers are refused at the word
- Closes by: design side, the arithmetic of the array model
- Evidence: claim D2.1 (1 | 1 2 3 + gives 2 3 4)

## list-elements
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py enclosure, element
- Default in force: ⟨ ⟩ holds literals only (numbers, strings, quotations, lists), each item one element, nothing strands inside; , joins two lists
- Closes by: design side, what a ⟨ ⟩ body may compute
- Evidence: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/08-objects-are-directories.fpl:7 (⟨⟩ as an empty accumulator)

## number-glyphs
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py atom
- Default in force: ∞ and π, which the affix pass reads as numbers, are refused as unimplemented; numbers are integers and decimals, a decimal kept exact as written
- Closes by: implementer, once an example that uses them evaluates
- Evidence: fpl/lex.py NUMBER; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft1/examples/draft1.fpl:29-32

## effect-query
- Depends on it: claim D3.4
- Default in force: each effect line is kept as declared data (fpl/ast_core.py Effect, on Define; EFFECTS for builtins); w/effect pushes a defined word's effect as a list of strings, ins, "--", outs, then "+fail" when a match in its body is partial (tests/test_match.py); the query words/*/effect is not implemented
- Closes by: the part that implements directories and paths
- Evidence: claim D3.4 (03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft3/examples/paths.fpl)

## stack-claims-deferred
- Depends on it: claims D1.6, D1.9, D1.10, D2.8, D2.10, D2.14, D2.15, D2.16 (part 02-stack)
- Default in force: open, their examples at no evaluator yet (D2.9 is paid by 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/07-scope-follows-the.expected, 2 4 6): D2.8 and D2.10 symbols, pair, dict, method, inverse; D2.14 and D2.15 unquote; D2.16 laziness; D1.6 apply, whose two-child if is refused (hole if-valence); D1.9 and D1.10 ∞, inner, log, repeat and a block of literals under a head that is not a definition
- Closes by: the parts that implement those words, each with a test named by its claim id
- Evidence: design/claims.jsonl rows with part 02-stack

## child-slots
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py _Desugar.children, child; tests/test_desugar.py test_a_child_under_a_thunk_or_code_slot_is_pushed_as_a_quotation
- Default in force: a child past the inputs of its head phrase fills no slot, so its slot is unknown: it is pushed as a quotation, as every child was before slots; a value child whose code reaches below its balance is a section, pushed whole (decision f)
- Closes by: design side, saying what a child past the head's inputs is (an error, or a quotation)
- Evidence: design doc FON tab S49 rule 5 ("a child is never run by its position, only by its head"); S42 (children push, head consumes)

## multi-word-head
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py _Desugar.inputs; tests/test_desugar.py test_a_child_under_a_value_slot_runs_at_once (+ dup times)
- Default in force: the children fill the inputs of the head phrase as a whole, all its frames joined, the first child the deepest input and the last the top; a word's inputs that the code before it does not supply lie under those already taken; with fewer children than inputs they fill the top ones and the rest come from the stack below
- Closes by: design side (question to Caesura: which slot a child fills under a head of several words, `+ sqrt`)
- Evidence: design doc FON tab S42 (hypot : a b -- c over + sqrt, two children); S49 rule 5 ("top to bottom")

## quotation-slot-words
- Depends on it: fpl/ast_core.py EFFECTS; tests/test_desugar.py test_join_takes_code_and_enclose_a_value, test_a_block_is_one_node_per_head (D1.4), test_children_are_quotations_before_the_head (D1.5)
- Default in force: , takes two code slots (it joins quotations as data, never runs them); enclose takes a value; curry and lcurry, defined in 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/02-currying.fpl with bare names, take values
- Closes by: design side (question to Caesura: are , enclose and curry code, thunk or polymorphic; , also joins lists, and curry takes a thunk in 11-laziness.fpl:3)
- Evidence: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/02-currying.fpl:2-5; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/11-laziness.fpl:3; claims D1.4, D1.5

## bare-slot-names
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py typed; every effect line in 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/ and tests/
- Default in force: a bare name on an effect line stays legal, an untyped value slot; only `name: Type` declares a thunk or code slot
- Closes by: design side (question to Caesura: do bare names stay, and do the old bracket slots `or : [ p ] [ q ]` survive)
- Evidence: design doc FON tab S49 item 1; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/sketch/examples/01-1-a-logic.fpl:12-13

## thunk-type-dropped
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py slot, declaration; tests/test_desugar.py test_core_without_sugar_writes_back_as_its_source
- Default in force: the core keeps each input's slot, not its type: `x: Int` is written back as `x`, `t: [ -- x ]` as `t: []`, `c: Code` as itself; an output's type is read past
- Closes by: fpl/types.py (types part), keeping the declared types it checks
- Evidence: design doc FON tab S49 item 1 (`f : x: Int  y: Int -- z: Int`)

## double-use-refusal
- Depends on it: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/server/examples/server.fpl:21 (a ;; comment, not run)
- Default in force: not refused in this part: a quotation both forced and inspected needs a kind on each stack cell through dup, which desugar does not track
- Closes by: fpl/types.py (#59, types), carrying thunk and code kinds through the stack and refusing the double use
- Evidence: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/server/examples/server.fpl:19-21; design doc FON tab S49 rule 5

## number-bound
- Depends on it: fpl/ast_core.py DIGITS, fpl/desugar.py number, fpl/eval.py arithmetic, tests/test_desugar.py::test_a_numeral_longer_than_digits_is_refused_at_its_position, ::test_a_result_of_more_than_digits_digits_is_refused_at_the_word
- Default in force: a numeral has at most 4096 digits, its sign and point not counted, the number FON's reader bounds a token by (fon.read max_token); a longer one is ERROR: <line>:<col> number too long at the numeral. 4096 is under Python's 4300-digit int/str conversion limit, so the bound is the language's, not the interpreter's setting. A result of + - times of magnitude 10^4096 or more is ERROR: <line>:<col> number too large at the word, so an integer has at most 4096 digits, written or computed, and a decimal never overflows its context; a computed decimal keeps the context's 28 significant digits and its fraction is not bounded
- Closes by: design, naming the bound on a number, written and computed (or none, with a reader and printer that never meet the limit)
- Evidence: a 4301-digit numeral raised ValueError from int() in fpl/desugar.py number before this entry, a traceback past the FplError boundary of fpl/__main__.py, as 10 squared 13 times did from str() in fpl/desugar.py shown and 9.9 squared 22 times did as decimal.Overflow in fpl/eval.py; .agents/CONVENTIONS.md "no Python traceback ever reaches the user"

## binder-scope
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py (body, quote, scoped), fpl/eval.py (substitute), tests/test_binders.py
- Default in force: →x names the top for the rest of the sequence it is written in: a definition's body across its lines and the blocks under them, one top-level line, one child line under a thunk or code slot, one quotation or section; a child under a value slot runs in place, so its binder lives on in the sequence the child runs in, like a frame's (hole child-slots); eval substitutes the value for the name there (lexical, a nested binder of the name shadows, nothing mutates); past it the name is no word; the printer writes → for both spellings
- Closes by: design, by saying where a binder's scope ends at top level and in a child line
- Evidence: decision (f); 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/server/examples/server.fpl:3-4 (p bound on one body line, read on the next); 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/07-scope-follows-the.fpl:3-5; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/08-objects-are-directories.fpl:6-10 rebinds acc and s in a repeat child and reads acc after it, which shadowing cannot give

## dict-values
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py (dict), fpl/eval.py (gathered), tests/test_binders.py
- Default in force: { } pairs a plain name key with the next item, which must push exactly one value (a literal, symbol, list, quotation, dict, bound name or a word taking none); each value runs on a fresh stack when the dict is reached; ( ) as a value, a strand, an odd count and a path key are refused as unimplemented; a repeated key is refused where it repeats with fpl/fon.py's message; symbols do not strand
- Closes by: design, by saying what a dict value may be and where one ends
- Evidence: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/06-6-python-s-keywords.fpl:2-5; fpl/fon.py dict; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/08-objects-are-directories.fpl:3 (#x #y swap)

## require-ensure-rescue
- Depends on it: nothing yet
- Default in force: no example uses require, ensure or rescue; they are unknown words, refused as unimplemented
- Closes by: design, with an example of f/require
- Evidence: grep -l over 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/*/examples/*.fpl finds none; decision (f)

## directory-log
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py (Catalog, directory, mount, _Desugar.call, origin), tests/test_binders.py; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft3/examples/paths.fpl:1-9, 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/05-5-prolog-s-family.fpl:2, 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/server/examples/server.fpl:4
- Default in force: a head name/ with a block is a directory; its definitions, subdirectories and #name bind mounts form one ordered log, read whole before any line runs (the rule top-level definitions already follow), where the latest entry holding a name wins; a word is a directory holding its history; a name resolves at desugar time from the word's own directory outward, ../x from the directory holding the word; a mount sees only the words its directory defines, never its mounts; a second head of the same name appends to the same log; a name/ head without a block, a deeper a/b/ head, any other line in a directory, bind of anything but a literal #name, a #name that is no directory and ../x on a top-level line are refused as unimplemented
- Closes by: design, by saying whether a log entry is visible above the line that adds it, whether mounts chain, and what a directory holds besides definitions and binds
- Evidence: claims D3.1 (paths.fpl:7 "ordered log append (§5.2): later shadows earlier"), D3.5 (paths.fpl:13 "takes ../io lexically"); decision (f) f/require; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/sketch/examples/07-7-facts-signed.fpl:18 binds a quotation of paths, which this default refuses

## history-shape
- Depends on it: fpl/eval.py (evaluate), fpl/desugar.py (HISTORY), tests/test_binders.py; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft3/examples/paths.fpl:11
- Default in force: w/history pushes a ⟨ ⟩ list of the definitions of w that a later one shadows, oldest first, each its body as a quotation; the one in force is not in it; one definition gives ⟨⟩
- Closes by: design, by saying what a history entry is (body, effect, source) and whether the one in force belongs to it
- Evidence: claim D3.3 (paths.fpl:11 "shadowed definitions")

## effect-sugar-io
- Depends on it: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft3/examples/paths.fpl:13, 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/server/examples/server.fpl:2 and 10
- Default in force: only the lexical half of D3.5 is in force (../x resolves from the directory holding the word); an effect line naming +io or any +effect is refused as unimplemented, so nothing threads an effect linearly
- Closes by: the effects part, with the design saying what +io desugars to
- Evidence: claim D3.5 (paths.fpl:13 "sugar: takes ../io lexically, threads it linearly (§4.3 answer)")

## with-record-union
- Depends on it: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/06-6-python-s-keywords.fpl:5
- Default in force: with is no word and is refused as unimplemented; it needs record patterns in a head (06-6-python-s-keywords.fpl:2), which no part implements yet
- Closes by: implementer of 06-match, after record-pattern heads
- Evidence: claim D4.12 ("with: curry-with-union; later calls still override")

## qualified-resugar
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py (resugar, named, written), tests/test_print.py
- Default in force: resugar writes a definition inside a directory as a top-level path head (m/sq : x -- y), which does not parse back to the same statement; the printer's round trip holds only for programs without directories, the only ones its strategies generate
- Closes by: implementer, by resugaring the log as nested name/ heads when a property needs it
- Evidence: fpl/desugar.py written

## control-effects
- Depends on it: fpl/ast_core.py EFFECTS, fpl/desugar.py balance, tests/test_control.py
- Default in force: each control word declares one fixed effect for saturation, whatever its quotation does: ! q -- x, if c t e --, swap-args x y q -- z, repeat q n --, each and scan xs q -- ys, fold xs q -- x; a quotation that does otherwise shows at run time as an underflow or as values left over (1 [+] ! is ERROR: 1:4 stack underflow); a frame in which the control word itself finds too few is a section, as saturation-balance says (1 [2] [3] if 1 + prints [ 1 [ 2 ] [ 3 ] if 1 + ]); the mechanism is the builtin effect table
- Closes by: the types part, inferring a quotation's effect and checking the word against it
- Evidence: combined-draft.md:134 (if : c t e --, fixed valence); claims D2.4, D2.13; no document gives the outputs of !

## truth-values
- Depends on it: fpl/eval.py choose, tests/test_control.py
- Default in force: if takes the integer 0 or 1 and refuses anything else with "if takes 0 or 1"; the 0/1 of the array model's comparisons, reused
- Closes by: design side, naming the truth values
- Evidence: combined-draft.md:134; draft-2.md:17-18 (my-if forces c before if)

## if-valence
- Depends on it: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft1/examples/draft1.fpl:16-18 (apply), tests/test_control.py
- Default in force: if : c t e -- with c a value; a block under if gives t and e, children first, so the form works where c is already below, as in a body; draft1's two-child apply, a condition quotation and one branch, meets a non-0/1 condition and is refused; there is no when
- Closes by: syntax author, rewriting draft1's apply with when : c t -- as combined-draft row 14 says
- Evidence: combined-draft.md:134; draft-1.md:20-22

## step-stack
- Depends on it: fpl/eval.py single, each, scan, fold; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/07-scope-follows-the, 09-rotates
- Default in force: each runs its quotation on a fresh stack holding one item, scan and fold on one holding the result so far and the next item; a step leaves one value or is refused with "each step leaves one value"; the first item starts scan and fold, and fold over nothing is refused (ERROR at fold, "fold over nothing"), so draft-2's mean, whose comment says empty input gives ∞, cannot reach ∞ through [+] fold; the mechanism is gathered's fresh stack for a dict value
- Closes by: design side, if a step may reach below its item, and whether fold takes a seed or mean is rewritten
- Evidence: claim D2.13; draft-1.md:6; draft-2.md:23-25 (mean)

## sequence-shape
- Depends on it: fpl/eval.py items, rebuilt; tests/test_control.py
- Default in force: each, scan and fold take a strand or a ⟨ ⟩ list; each and scan give a strand back when they took one and every result is a number or a string, else a list; any other value as the sequence is refused
- Closes by: design side, the array model
- Evidence: combined-draft.md:44 (the one carrier is the nested array)

## text-as-array
- Depends on it: claims D1.1, D1.2, D1.3; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft1/examples/draft1.fpl:1-5
- Default in force: tab = and trim space split pair are no words and each over a string is refused, so draft1's read stays at no evaluator yet; D1.2's scan then fold is tested on a strand of 0 and 1, times standing for and
- Closes by: a later part, adding characters and the text words
- Evidence: draft-1.md:4-8

## pair-shape
- Depends on it: fpl/eval.py pair, unpair; tests/test_match.py
- Default in force: a b pair is the two-item list ⟨ a b ⟩, so a pair prints as a list and ( cons x xs ) matches it; cons : x xs -- ys puts x before a list's items, the order ( cons x xs ) gives
- Closes by: design, saying what a pair is and cons's argument order
- Evidence: 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/01-1-constructors-run.fpl:5-8; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/04-4-list-patterns.fpl:5,8 (x y pair cons after xs ys zip reads cons as xs x -- ys)

## match-arity
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py _Desugar.match, row; tests/test_match.py
- Default in force: a match line takes the values the body's balance counts where it stands (the effect line's inputs, less what binders took), and leaves the balance at 0; a row is that many pattern cells then at most a body cell, else refused at the row; match outside a definition's body is an unknown word
- Closes by: design, saying what a match takes and whether code may follow it
- Evidence: claim D4.7; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/05-5-prolog-s-family.fpl:3-8

## match-consumes
- Depends on it: fpl/eval.py matching; tests/test_match.py test_a_symmetric_case_delegates
- Default in force: a match takes its values; a row's body sees only the names its patterns bind, so _ leaves nothing behind
- Closes by: design, for claim D4.4, whose row body swap collide reads the values the match took
- Evidence: claim D4.4; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/03-3-multiple-dispatch.fpl:5; :4 and :7 leave one value only if the match takes its arguments

## pin-scope
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py _Desugar.simple, local; tests/test_match.py
- Default in force: $x pins a name bound by a binder or by an earlier pattern of the row; effect-line names are no locals (as in every body), so $x of one is refused as unimplemented
- Closes by: design, saying whether an effect line's names are bound in its body
- Evidence: claim D4.6; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/04-4-list-patterns.fpl:13-14 (pins x, the effect line's name)

## guard-test
- Depends on it: fpl/eval.py matched; tests/test_match.py
- Default in force: p ∈ test matches when p does and the word test, run on the value alone, leaves just 1; types are not implemented, so pos, Ship and Asteroid are unknown words, refused as unimplemented
- Closes by: fpl/types.py (07-goals and types), ascription to a type
- Evidence: claims D4.1, D4.4; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/01-1-constructors-run.fpl:12

## exhaustive-by-catch-all
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py fallible, catches; tests/test_match.py test_a_match_is_exhaustive_exactly_when_its_effect_has_no_fail
- Default in force: a match is exhaustive when some row's patterns are all _ or names; ⟨⟩ then ( cons x xs ) is partial and carries +fail; a written +fail on an effect line is not read
- Closes by: fpl/types.py, exhaustiveness over a type's constructors
- Evidence: claim D4.5; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/04-4-list-patterns.fpl:3-5

## fail-raises
- Depends on it: fpl/eval.py matching
- Default in force: no row matching is ERROR at the match word, "no row matches"; nothing catches it (rescue is unimplemented)
- Closes by: design, with rescue or a space's backtracking
- Evidence: claims D4.5, D4.8; decision (f) "+fail if non-exhaustive"

## invertible-when-tried
- Depends on it: fpl/eval.py undone, unrun; tests/test_match.py test_only_an_invertible_word_is_a_pattern
- Default in force: a constructor pattern names a word taking its patterns and leaving one value, checked in desugar; that its body is swap, pair, cons, literal pushes and such words, no recursion, is checked when the row is tried, refused at the pattern's head
- Closes by: implementer, a check over every definition once desugar holds all bodies
- Evidence: campaign scope 06-match "using any other word as a pattern is an error"

## resugar-match
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py spelled; tests/test_match.py test_a_match_is_not_written_back_as_code
- Default in force: code holding a match is not written back (w/history of a shadowed word with one); refused as unimplemented
- Closes by: implementer, writing a match as a line with its block
- Evidence: fpl/desugar.py listing, written

## effect-head-defaults
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py effect_line; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/06-6-python-s-keywords.fpl; tests/test_match.py test_a_record_pattern_in_a_head_waits_for_defaults
- Default in force: an effect line is plain names only; a record pattern in the head (claim D4.11, S39: sep and end bound by the pattern, the caller's record unioned over the defaults) is refused as unimplemented, ERROR: 1:1 no evaluator yet
- Closes by: the part that implements records as signatures and with (S39), outside 06-match's scope; design, saying where a head's defaults bind
- Evidence: claim D4.11; 03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/match/examples/06-6-python-s-keywords.fpl:2-3; fpl/desugar.py effect_line

## typed-fragment
- Depends on it: fpl/types.py Kind, ARROWS, met, matched, agreed; tests/test_types.py test_a_well_typed_program_runs_to_a_value and test_a_step_keeps_the_sorts_a_state_leaves (the obligations of [fpl.types]), test_an_input_a_row_does_arithmetic_on_is_a_number_for_its_word, test_rows_agree_on_the_sort_a_later_row_finds, test_a_dead_row_counts_for_the_sorts_its_word_leaves
- Default in force: sorts are number, text, symbol and value; a match's rows are typed, a name a pattern binds of no known sort, and every row counts for its word's sorts, dead rows included (decided by PSJ, 2026-10-05): a sort any row finds for a value under the match or a name around it holds for the whole word, and the rows agree on what they leave, even where a pattern means a row never runs (a first _ row leaving a number and a later _ row leaving a text leave value, not number); pruning rows by verdict serves only static dispatch at a call site (fpl/types.py chosen), never this agreement, since a row wrongly pruned from it could return a sort the word does not promise, while with every row counting a bug in pruning can only over-refuse; OCaml 5.5 does the same, typing `let f x = match x with _ -> 0 | _ -> x + 1` as int -> int with Warning 11 (this match case is unused); no warning for a row that never runs is built; value is untracked and trusted (lists, quotations, dicts, strands of mixed items, what enclose , pair cons and a word with an untyped body leave), so arithmetic on one passes elaboration and may still fail at run time; a body calling a word defined later meets that word's effect line with values of no tracked sort; progress and preservation are stated over programs of number, text and symbol pushes, dup swap drop + - times, binders, matches of _ rows that agree on the sorts they leave, and words calling earlier words
- Closes by: fpl/types.py, sorts for lists, quotations and dicts and arrows for control words; design, whether a list or a quotation carries its items' or its code's type
- Evidence: fpl/ast_core.py EFFECTS and hole control-effects; claim D2.7 ("_ would ask it to infer")

## infer-hole
- Depends on it: fpl/types.py filled; fpl/eval.py nothing; tests/test_types.py test_a_hole_in_a_term_is_inferred_as_nothing, test_a_hole_that_is_not_nothing_is_refused_at_its_span; tests/test_match.py test_what_is_no_pattern_is_refused (_ as a row's body)
- Default in force: _ in a term is inferred only as nothing: accepted when the code after it takes the stack as it stands (and, at the end of a body, the effect line's count), run as a no-op; otherwise ERROR: <line>:<col> cannot infer _ : <ins> -- <outs>, the shape a goal there would report; no code is synthesised; a _ in code elaboration does not type runs as nothing
- Closes by: design side, what the elaborator may infer for _ (D2.7 "_ would ask it to infer"), and whether a _ in untyped code is refused
- Evidence: claim D2.7 (03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/04-effects-holes-ascription.fpl:5); handoff/SHAR-syntax.org:1016 (S40: "_ is inferred by the elaborator (or a wildcard, or absence)")

## symbolic-lane-unbounded
- Depends on it: make harden and make ready (.harness/quality/noslop.mk:81, HYPOTHESIS_PROFILE=symbolic pytest); every unit's gate.ready
- Default in force: the symbolic lane is not run; the six bounded lanes of the orchestrator's amendment stand in for make ready: check, the harden profile, crosshair icontract at 20 s per condition, mutants, gates, pip-audit
- Closes by: maintainer, a per-test budget for the symbolic lane in .harness/quality/, then a full make ready
- Evidence: .harness/quality/noslop.mk:81; orchestrator amendment 2026-09-28 21:50 (a run passed 27 minutes and was killed)

## mutant-verdicts-vary-between-runs
- Depends on it: mutants.allow, .harness/scripts/mutants (quality lane d)
- Default in force: every allowed entry is kept even when a run reports it as no longer living, since dropping one that lives on the next run fails the gate; the gate reports stale entries and does not fail on them; runs on one head differ (9 allowed entries reported no longer living on 7d1c179 in one run, none in the next); returned also as mutmut-run-dependent-kills
- Closes by: maintainer, deciding whether a Hypothesis-random kill falsifies an "equivalent" reason, or pinning the seed or profile .harness/scripts/mutants runs the suite under, then pruning mutants.allow
- Evidence: mutants.allow; .harness/scripts/mutants; session pr/05-comments.md (its PR note; the run logs are not kept)

## log-hash-stand-in
- Depends on it: fpl/multihash.py (hashed), fpl/log.py (every id, body name and MAC), fpl/session.py (evaluator)
- Default in force: blake2b-256 (multihash code 45600) from the standard library, one current code per store; blake3 (code 30) is refused as unknown
- Closes by: maintainer, a root [policy] commit adding blake3 to the lock, then switching the current code to 30; stored ids keep their code and are not rehashed
- Evidence: combined-draft.md:161 (row 39, blake3-256), as amended by PSJ's decisions of 2026-09-29 (decimal multihash, $45600 and &45600 on blake2b-256 now); .harness/quality/uv.lock holds no blake3; fpl/multihash.py:47

## log-signing
- Depends on it: fpl/log.py (keyed, the MAC), tests/test_log.py
- Default in force: a symmetric MAC, blake2b-256 keyed over the id's multihash bytes and outside the id's preimage; the key is $FPL_LOG_KEY, else $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fpl/log.key, else ~/.config/fpl/log.key, created mode 0600 on first use
- Closes by: design, choosing the signature of C6's signed feeds; a signature replaces the MAC and ids stay unchanged
- Evidence: combined-draft.md:38 (C6, append-only signed single-writer logs); PSJ's decisions of 2026-09-29 (the MAC stays outside the hashed preimage); fpl/log.py:126

## log-checkpoint
- Depends on it: fpl/session.py (enter, program), fpl/log.py (load)
- Default in force: every call loads and re-verifies the whole log and runs every accepted input up to the event again as one file, and an input runs the program at its state once more, the baseline of CHANGED, under the fuel its last input was accepted with, which names nothing when it no longer runs within that fuel (a log written under another evaluator)
- Closes by: design, a checkpoint of frontier and state hash (row 50) once the cost is measured
- Evidence: combined-draft.md:172 (row 50, checkpoints certified by a hash of the frontier); fpl/session.py:63, :173, :199; fpl/log.py:313

## log-v0-in-fpl
- Depends on it: fpl/log.py, fpl/session.py
- Default in force: events named by the hash of their header, with deps (the state they extend) and links (a rewind's abandoned head), not v0's positional ids; this log is the first slice of v0 in FPL and the Rust v0 spike is abandoned
- Closes by: PSJ, with an FPL v0 prototype that reads these logs
- Evidence: PSJ's decisions of 2026-09-29; v0 repository a4dac05 src/event.rs:27-34 (Event with parents and links)

## repl-bare-entry
- Depends on it: fpl/__main__.py, tests/test_main.py:70-72
- Default in force: bare python -m fpl prints its usage line and exits 2; the loop is python -m fpl.repl
- Closes by: maintainer, either .agents/CONVENTIONS.md naming python -m fpl.repl or bare python -m fpl routed to fpl.repl.main
- Evidence: .agents/CONVENTIONS.md:21 (python -m fpl starts the REPL); tests/test_main.py:70-72; PSJ's decisions of 2026-09-29 (entry python -m fpl.repl, python -m fpl FILE unchanged)

## log-layering-unchecked
- Depends on it: fpl/multihash.py, fpl/log.py, fpl/session.py
- Default in force: no import-linter contract names the three modules; log imports multihash, fon and errors, never driver, by convention only
- Closes by: maintainer, a root [policy] commit adding them to .harness/quality/importlinter.ini
- Evidence: .harness/quality/importlinter.ini:46-60 (driver-on-top names fpl.repl only as a forbidden target)

## fuel-scope
- Depends on it: fpl/eval.py (metered), fpl/driver.py (FUEL_DEFAULT, run), fpl/repl.py (--fuel), tests/test_fuel.py, tests/test_main.py
- Default in force: 1,000,000 steps per top-level run line, in a file run and in each REPL event, nested runs counted, the budget recorded in each event; out of fuel is an error at the run's line
- Closes by: design, choosing the unit the budget bounds (line, input or session)
- Evidence: fpl/eval.py:95; fpl/driver.py:14; [ 1 drop ] 100000 repeat took 500,003 steps in 1.23 s at 4e26338 (about 2.5 s per line at the default)

## log-fsync-barrier
- Depends on it: fpl/log.py (write, keyed), the law write-ahead (tests/test_repl.py)
- Default in force: os.fsync of each file and its directory; on macOS it does not flush the drive's cache (F_FULLFSYNC), so a power loss can lose an append that was printed
- Closes by: maintainer, a per-platform coverage policy under which a darwin branch to fcntl.F_FULLFSYNC can be kept at 100%
- Evidence: fpl/log.py:370, :385, :420, :490; fcntl.F_FULLFSYNC exists on darwin only; .harness/quality/coveragerc:10 (fail_under = 100)

## repl-transcript
- Depends on it: fpl/repl.py, fpl/session.py (enter), tests/test_repl.py, tests/test_session.py
- Default in force: an error in an earlier event is ERROR: @<seq> <l>:<c>; CHANGED <seq> $<id> names an earlier input whose output differs from the run of the state the input extends, so once, at the input that moves it; HEAD <seq> $<id> follows an append on stderr; an input after the first starts at the left margin; an input ends at a blank line or once it is not pending; a first line with : is a command (:show :log :rewind E :canonical :quit); joined outputs differ from the file's only where a run leaves a single empty stack; at a terminal a tab inserts itself (GNU readline; libedit untried)
- Closes by: design, fixing the transcript's form
- Evidence: tests/test_session.py:119, :128, :185, :195; tests/test_repl.py:265, :300, :355; fpl/print.py:24-31

## head-group-pin
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py `_Desugar.code`, tests/test_overload.py test_a_pin_in_a_head_group_is_refused
- Default in force: a `$` pin inside a head group `( p )` is refused as unimplemented; a group clause binds its other inputs by fresh names `x′i` (the dispatcher-row mechanism), so a pin by the written name could not resolve
- Closes by: the part that binds head names, by binding a head's written names
- Evidence: design-09-v3.md §2.1 (Groups), §10 head-group-pin

## group-clause-fails
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py `_Desugar.statements`, `tests`; `f/n/i/effect` of a clause with a head group
- Default in force: a clause with a head group keeps `fallible(code)`, so its own effect is `+fail` (its one row misses when called by path); its dispatcher's `+fail` is computed from the dispatcher's rows, as for every match
- Closes by: the design side, by choosing between the written line and the computed `+fail` for `f/n/i/effect`
- Evidence: design-09-v3.md §1.1 (`f/n/i` effect as written) against §3.5 (a group clause's own +fail)

## dispatch-order
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py `_Desugar.dispatcher`, `crossed`, `disjoint`, `met`; tests/test_overload.py test_the_most_specific_then_the_newest_fitting_clause_wins, test_p1_and_p2, test_rows_sort_by_typed_count_then_newest, test_p3_is_refused_until_its_meet_is_a_clause, test_crossing_clauses_are_refused_unless_their_meet_is_a_clause
- Default in force: order B as the orchestrator defined it: a clause's typed inputs decide its specificity, whatever the types; rows sort by typed-input count descending, newest first by path ordinal among as many; crossing clauses are refused at the later head unless disjoint (two different builtin type words the program does not define) or their meet is a clause; a meet one input would type two ways is refused as unimplemented. First-row-wins `Match` reuses eval's `matching`
- Closes by: palimpsest, confirming the definition and amending combined-draft row 18 ("No automatic specificity") and row 73 for overloading, PSJ confirming; both pending
- Evidence: design-09-v3.md Read first, §3.1-§3.3; combined-draft.md:138 (row 18), :197 (row 73)

## tie-age
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py `Catalog.keyed`, `Catalog.ordinal`; tests/test_overload.py test_a_shadowing_clause_keeps_its_age, test_a_clause_keeps_the_ordinal_of_its_key
- Default in force: a same-key redefinition shadows its clause in place and keeps its path ordinal, which is its age among equally specific clauses (the log's later-shadows-earlier, keyed by path)
- Closes by: PSJ, choosing between keeping the place and taking the newest ordinal
- Evidence: design-09-v3.md §3.4 (Newest under shadowing), §11

## repl-crossing-order
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py `crossed`, run on every prefix a session desugars
- Default in force: the crossing check runs on the whole program each time; a file whose meet follows both crossing clauses is accepted, while typed into the REPL in that order the second crossing clause is refused, so the meet must be entered first
- Closes by: the design side, by accepting the narrowing of "REPL equals file" or deferring the check
- Evidence: design-09-v3.md §3.3 (The REPL checks every prefix)

## group-disjoint
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py `disjoint`
- Default in force: a head group is disjoint from nothing, since two groups may both match one value (`⟨ #circle ⟨ #rect 5 ⟩ ⟩`); two group clauses at one input are equally specific and the newest wins
- Closes by: the design side, if constructor patterns gain a static disjointness
- Evidence: design-09-v3.md §3.1 (Disjoint), §4 P7

## ambiguity-wording
- Depends on it: fpl/desugar.py `agree`, `crossed`; tests/test_overload.py test_clauses_of_one_arity_leave_as_many_values, test_crossing_clauses_are_refused_unless_their_meet_is_a_clause
- Default in force: an output-count mismatch reads `f/1/2 leaves 2, f/1/1 1`, after the slot-kind message `f/1/2 takes a thunk at 1, f/1/1 a value`; the meet in `g/2/2 is ambiguous with g/2/1 at x: Int  y: Int` takes the earlier clause's slot names
- Closes by: the design side, by fixing the wording
- Evidence: design-09-v3.md §2.3, §3.3, §11 (the wording of the ambiguity error); the design gives no output-count message

## refusal-not-fail
- Depends on it: fpl/ast_core.py `Refuse`; fpl/desugar.py `fallible`; tests/test_overload.py test_an_ambiguity_is_a_refusal_not_a_miss, test_p5_refuses_a_call_both_crossing_clauses_fit
- Default in force: landed in C10: an ambiguous call raises an `FplError` at the dispatcher's span, never `FailError`; `fallible` counts no `Refuse` row, so it adds no +fail; the walker has no `or` to tell the two apart outside guards
- Closes by: the part that lands `or`, which must catch `FailError` (`no row matches`) only
- Evidence: design-09-v3.md §3.4, §10 (refusal-not-fail)

## guard-failure
- Depends on it: fpl/eval.py `matched` (a guard's test), fpl/errors.py `FailError`; tests/test_overload.py test_a_guard_that_misses_is_not_fitting, test_an_error_in_a_guard_propagates
- Default in force: landed in C10, decided: a predicate used as a slot type must be total over the values it can meet; a test that fails with `no row matches` (`FailError`) is a miss, in dispatcher and match rows alike; an ambiguity refusal, fuel exhaustion or any other error inside the test propagates out of the call as that error
- Closes by: PSJ, only to widen the miss; order B itself waits on the row-18 amendment (dispatch-order), pending
- Evidence: design-09-v3.md §3.9, §10 (guard-failure); combined-draft.md:138 (row 18)

## number-split
- Depends on it: fpl/types.py `tested`
- Default in force: types has one number sort, so neither `Int` nor `Decimal` surely misses a number, and a more specific maybe row before a sure one keeps the call dynamic (P1's `5 f`)
- Closes by: types, by splitting the number sort, which lets `Int` surely miss a decimal and `Decimal` an integer; a guarded row stays at most maybe (static-dispatch-residual)
- Evidence: design-09-v3.md §3.6, §10 (number-split)

## static-miss
- Depends on it: fpl/types.py `chosen`; tests/test_overload.py test_a_call_types_leaves_unresolved_fails_at_run_time
- Default in force: a call no row can fit keeps the dispatcher's arrow and is `no row matches` +fail at run time; types neither refuses nor warns
- Closes by: types, with a warning
- Evidence: design-09-v3.md §3.6, §10 (static-miss)

## static-dispatch-residual
- Depends on it: fpl/types.py `chosen`, `surviving`, `tested`, `taken`; tests/test_overload.py test_types_resolves_a_dispatch_where_one_clause_row_survives, test_static_and_dynamic_dispatch_agree, test_a_guarded_row_is_never_a_sure_fit
- Default in force: pruning rows by verdict serves only static dispatch at a call site (`chosen`); a match in a body prunes nothing, every row of it counting for its word's sorts, dead rows included (decided by PSJ, 2026-10-05; hole typed-fragment), where design-09-v3.md §3.6 prunes there too; a row with a guard or an ascription (a cell with ∈, or `x: w`) is never a sure fit, so pruning never stops at it and TEXT_FIRST's `“a” f` keeps its catch-all row; a call keeps the dispatcher's arrow when a synthetic row survives, when an argument is an `Input` (even to a lone untyped clause of a two-group word), and when the one surviving row is a maybe whose clause's arrow refuses the argument sorts (`x: one` with body `1 +` on `“a”`: the run misses, so types does not refuse)
- Closes by: the design side, by accepting the maybe-row condition and the guard rule, which §3.6 does not state, and by taking body-match pruning out of §3.6
- Evidence: design-09-v3.md §3.6 (Pruning, Why an `Input` blocks resolution), §10 (static-dispatch-residual)
