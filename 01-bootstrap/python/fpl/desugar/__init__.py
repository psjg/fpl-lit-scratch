# 01.02.05 Desugar

Today this is `Syntax → Core`. [01.02.03-resolve](01.02.03-resolve.md),
[01.02.04-expand](01.02.04-expand.md), and
[01.02.07-lower](01.02.07-lower.md) are the arrows it stands in for.

Surface AST to core AST, and core back to surface for the printer. All
sugar is erased here.

A line runs on a fresh stack. Its frames join into one postfix sequence:
the bar carries the running arity balance across, and a frame whose
words would reach below the balance it starts on is a section, pushed
whole as a quotation (decision f). Literals side by side in a cell
strand. The lines of a block fill the inputs of their head, before its
tokens: a child under a value slot is its code, run at once; under a
thunk or code slot, a quotation (S49 rule 5). The block of a `:` head is
its body, whose balance starts at the effect line's inputs and runs on
from line to line. ( ) puts its head after its arguments. Quotation
bodies are code, never sections. →x names the top for the rest of its
line, body or quotation, where x pushes it (decision f); #x is a symbol;
{ } pairs literal keys with one item each. A head `name/` mounts its
block as a directory: its definitions are named by path, and each
directory keeps an ordered log of its definitions, subdirectories and
`#name bind` mounts, where a later entry shadows an earlier one. A
word's body is its own directory (decision f), so a name in it is looked
up from there outward, `..` from the directory holding the word, and
every word w has w/history, w/doc, its docstring, and w/effect. A
`match` line in a body takes the values its balance counts, and each
line of its block is a row: one pattern cell per value, then at most a
body cell. A pattern is _, a name it binds, a literal, $x, ( constructor
patterns ) or p ∈ test; a match with no row of only _ and names makes
its word's effect +fail. A line with no code, a comment's or the empty
first line, is no statement and no child; its comment is not carried
into the core, but for a word's docs (fpl/trivia.py). Anything outside
the implemented set is refused before evaluation (hole
unimplemented-words), at the source's start; but a call nothing answers
is refused at its word, as unknown or as not run yet (PLANNED). A word
with two or more keys, or one with a typed input, is dispatched (design
09 §1.1): its i-th key of arity n is the clause f/n/i, and f/n its
dispatcher, one row per clause guarding each typed input with its type
word and calling the clause, the most typed inputs first and the newest
first among as many; a call takes the arity group its balance picks.
A binary arithmetic word meeting exactly one value on a line's whole
stack is its one-value form, `+/1`, which folds a strand; written
back, it is the word again.
