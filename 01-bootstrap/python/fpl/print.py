"""
The surface AST as canonical source; the printer is the only normaliser.

Items are joined by a space, cells by a tab, frames by a bar between
spaces (an empty frame prints nothing); an enclosure prints as "o body
c", or "oc" when it holds one empty frame; a block line carries one tab
per level; a note stands in a cell of its own after its line's code, its
continuation lines carrying as many tabs as stand before it; a comment
is printed as written; a note on a line of its own after a line that
ends in a note has a blank line before it, which ends the note it would
otherwise continue; no code line ends in a space; a program ends in a
newline, and one empty line is the empty text.
