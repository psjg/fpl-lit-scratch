# AGENTS.md

The entry point for any agent — Claude, Codex, Gemini, a human, whatever — working in this
repo. Read it fully before touching anything. Nothing here is specific to one vendor; the only
vendor-specific notes live in `CLAUDE.md` and cover Claude Code's `.claude/` tooling.

## What this repo is right now

A **shared agent harness**. There is no compiler yet. The harness records the decisions that
are already settled and the conventions every implementation attempt must follow, so a fresh
session can pick up work without re-deciding groundwork.

The language *vision* is deliberately unwritten. It gets drawn out in a dedicated interview
(`02-docs/02.04-explanation/design.md`, populated by the `design-fpl` process). Until that
file has real content, do not invent language semantics.

Keep talk about the vision sober, and the harness small:
`02-docs/02.05-project/notes/02.05.02-sober.md`.

  01-bootstrap/       the walker: the Python implementation, a project of its own (the

                      walker corpus still reads; new conformance lives elsewhere later.

  worktrees/<name>/   one implementation attempt each; git-ignored; see .agents/WORKTREES.md
```

**Worktree model.** Each attempt at implementing FPL lives in its own linked worktree at
`worktrees/<name>/` on its own branch. Any checkout may hold any work: a harness change can be
made mid-attempt, in the worktree.

- A session edits inside its own checkout only — never sideways into another worktree.
- One commit changes harness paths or implementation paths, never both (`.agents/WORKTREES.md`
  lists the sides). `.harness/scripts/commit-lint.sh` judges every commit by it (`.harness/scripts/boundary.sh`), at
  push and in CI; a refusal (`BOUNDARY-MIXED`) prints the command that splits the commit.
- `.githooks/pre-commit` refuses a `git commit` with `main` checked out; the real gate is
  `.githooks/reference-transaction`, which lets `main` move only to where `github/main` already
  is, so local merges are refused too. Work on a stack branch (`.agents/WORKFLOW.md`).
- Details and `git worktree` recipes: `.agents/WORKTREES.md`.

## Settled decisions

Full rationale in `.agents/STACK.md`. In brief:

- **Stack:** Python 3.12+ + [Lark](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io) + frozen `@dataclass`
  nodes + structural `match` → tree-walking interpreter. Chosen for broad agent fluency.
- **Layered frontend:** source → **surface AST** → `desugar` → **tiny stable core AST** →
  semantics. All syntactic sugar dies in `desugar`. New syntax is a grammar + desugar change;
  the evaluator is left alone.
- **Spans everywhere:** every surface AST node carries a source span from parse time. Error
  quality is a feature.
- **Verifier:** `pyright` runs strict with exhaustive-`match` checking over the frozen
  dataclasses. A pyright error is a build failure.
- **Grammar ambiguity is a bug:** the grammar loads with `ambiguity='explicit'` and a test
  asserts zero ambiguity over the corpus.
- **Dependencies through Nix:** every dependency enters through the Nix flake, and nothing
  reaches a network at build or test time. `flake.nix` builds the `fpl` package from nixpkgs
  alone (`lib.pythonDeps`, `nix build .#fpl`), and `make nix-check` runs its REPL in the
  sandbox. The `nix-deps` step of `make check` refuses a name `01-bootstrap/pyproject.toml`
  declares that the flake does not provide, and deptry one the code imports undeclared. A new
  dependency goes into both in the same change.
- **Backend, later:** core IR → C → `clang` before anything LLVM. tree-sitter comes later and
  only for editor tooling, never as the semantic frontend.

## The one gate

Each worktree defines a single non-interactive check:

```
make check   # ruff, pyright and mypy strict, 100% branch coverage, CRAP <= 8, a property test per
             # module, layering, dependencies, dead and duplicate code (.agents/QUALITY.md)
```

`make check` green ⇔ the work is done. There is no other definition of done. Do not report a
feature complete on a red or unrun `make check`. Before a PR leaves draft, `make ready` adds
the long search: more examples, CrossHair, and mutation testing.

To run the walker, from the root of any checkout: `make run FILE=path/to/p.fpl` runs a file
and `make repl` starts the REPL (`make repl ARGS='--session s.log'`). The package is
`01-bootstrap/fpl`, so a bare `python -m fpl` from the root finds no module; `make check` ends by
running one example, which checks itself, through `make run` and requiring it to exit 0.

The gate's configuration is policy: it lives in the harness (`.harness/quality/`), a change to it
carries `[policy]` and no code, and `make check` refuses to run against an uncommitted one.
Do not loosen a check to get to green; say which check is wrong and why.

## The FPL image and the oracle

`03-fpl/**/*.md` (except `OLD/`) is the image source. `make tangle-fpl` writes a sibling
`.fpl`: prose becomes `;` comments; `fpl` (or bare) fences become raw source. Do not
hand-edit `.fpl` files; do not invent language semantics in those notes until the
maintainer has settled them.

The old conformance suite lives at `03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/` (`spec.md` +
`examples/*.fpl`, each checking itself with `|-`). The walker corpus still reads it. A new oracle home
is not chosen yet — do not scaffold new features under `03.01-features/`.

**The oracle rule still holds for what remains of the suite:** the maintainer writes the
fixtures; an agent makes `make check` green against them. If an agent writes both a
program and its own expected output, the oracle proves nothing.

`03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/*/spec.md`, `03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/*/examples/*`,
`02-docs/02.04-explanation/design.md`, and `02-docs/02.03-reference/spec.md` are
protected two ways: `.githooks/commit-msg` rejects a commit touching them without the
literal `[spec]` marker in the message, and the Claude `guard-specs` hook blocks the
edit unless the session sets `FPL_SPEC_EDIT=1`. Other harnesses honour the `[spec]` rule
by convention. If you think a spec is wrong, say so and let the maintainer decide —
don't route around it.

## Commits & workflow

- One-time per clone/worktree: **`.harness/scripts/setup.sh`** (wires `.githooks/`, stacked-commit git
  config, checks the author identity).
- Commit with **`.harness/scripts/acommit.sh`** — it builds the message to `.agents/COMMITS.md` and sets the
  machine-account author. `.githooks/commit-msg` validates every commit independently; a soft
  LLM `atomic-check` blocks commits that bundle unrelated changes.
- Work in **stacked commits** — small, ordered, individually reviewable; **`.harness/scripts/restack.sh`**
  rebases the stack when the base moves. See `.agents/WORKFLOW.md`. Prefer `jj`? `.agents/JJ.md`.
- **An approved PR is frozen.** Rewrite freely until the maintainer approves; after that,
  fix forward in a new PR on top (`.agents/WORKFLOW.md` rule 10; `.githooks/pre-push` refuses).
- **Land through a GitHub PR, always** (rebase-merge, never a local merge into `main`). The
  `Stack:` trailer on every commit keeps the grouping in the repo once the refs are deleted.
- Authorship model (machine account + `claude[bot]` App): `.agents/COMMITS.md`.
- The task graph (`.harness/scripts/task`, Radicle COBs in the repository): `.agents/TASKS.md`. The store
  exists; no task has been written to it yet.

## Coding standards

Lean code, elaborate formatted doc comments, TDD, semantic commits at logical checkpoints,
performance treated as a feature. (Claude sessions: load the `software-style` and
`software-method` skills.)

## Picking up work

0. Enter the dev shell: `direnv allow` once, or `nix develop -c <command>` (`.agents/DEVSHELL.md`;
   a bare interactive `nix develop` is unreliable on macOS). It carries every tool below at a
   pinned version and wires the git hooks on first entry. Check: `command -v ruff` prints a
   `/nix/store/…` path. It has no forge client; `gh` is an opt-in layer, per checkout:
   `.harness/scripts/layer.sh on github`, or `nix develop .#github -c gh …`.
1. Read this file, `.agents/STACK.md`, `.agents/CONVENTIONS.md`, `.agents/COMMITS.md`, `.agents/WORKFLOW.md`,
   `.agents/BRANCHES.md`.
2. Pick a worktree (`git worktree list`) or make one (`.harness/scripts/new-worktree.sh <name>`; see
   `.agents/WORKTREES.md`).
3. In it, find work whose `make check` is red — walker holes, image notes under `03-fpl/`,
   or docs under `02-docs/`. Do not scaffold new dirs under `03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/`.
4. Implement to green (`make tangle-fpl` when you change image markdown).
5. Check for code-vs-spec drift against the archived corpus before declaring walker work done.
