# COMMITS.md — commit message & authorship convention

Every commit MUST follow this. The header is
[Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/); the trailer
block is a [git trailer](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers) list. Together they
give a log that `git log --format`, `git interpret-trailers --parse`, and a changelog
generator can all read, while staying legible for a human doing archaeology years later.

`.harness/scripts/acommit.sh` assembles a compliant message; `.githooks/commit-msg` validates every
commit independently. Each rule below is marked **[gate]** (a hook rejects violations) or
**[advisory]** (documented, not machine-checkable — a hook cannot reliably tell).

The hook only sees a commit made with git, in a clone whose hooks are wired.
`git commit --no-verify`, an unwired clone and `jj` (`.agents/JJ.md`) get past it. So the same
gates run a second time where they cannot be skipped: `.harness/scripts/commit-lint.sh <rev-range>` runs
the hook over commits that already exist, and `.github/workflows/commit-lint.yml` does that
for every commit of a pull request. `.githooks/pre-push` runs it too, over the commits a push
adds to a branch, judged for the branch they arrive at: a commit moved since it was made
(cherry-pick, `rebase --onto`, `branch -f`) still carries the `Stack:` of the branch it left,
and is refused before it reaches the forge. By hand, for a branch based on `main`:

```
.harness/scripts/commit-lint.sh -b "$(git branch --show-current)" github/main..HEAD
```

For a branch based on a parent not merged yet, the base is that parent on the remote, so
the parent's commits, which may carry another `Stack:`, are left out as the hook leaves
them out. Set `PARENT` to the parent branch's name first:

```
PARENT=agent/claude/stack/parent-name
.harness/scripts/commit-lint.sh -b "$(git branch --show-current)" "github/$PARENT..HEAD"
```

The agent addresses it accepts beside `.git/agent-identity` come from one of two lists. In
CI the workflow sets `FPL_AGENT_EMAILS` inline, and that list is the only one trusted: the
checkout is the pull request's own tree, so a pull request could otherwise add its author to
a file and pass. The file `.github/agent-emails` serves the local hooks (`commit-msg`,
`pre-push`), which run with the variable unset, and must be a subset of the workflow's list;
`.harness/scripts/commit-lint.sh` refuses, naming the address, when the file lists one the variable
lacks. Add an address to the workflow first (an agent's token cannot push
`.github/workflows/`, so the owner does), then to the file.

Judged after the fact, a `fixup!`, `squash!` or `amend!` commit fails (a rebase-merge would
land it as it is), and the atomicity check is skipped. When it is made, such a commit is
spared every gate but the path guards: one that edits a protected spec or policy file carries
its own marker (`git commit --fixup=<commit> -m "[spec]"`).

A real merge and a real revert pass unjudged, since git wrote their messages. A merge is a
`Merge ...` commit with more than one parent (or one in the making); a revert is a commit,
under any title, whose line `This reverts commit <id>` names a commit the branch already
holds (an ancestor of the revert's parent), in either form git writes (`<sha>.` under its
`Revert "..."` or `Reapply "..."` title, or `<abbrev> (<subject>, <date>).` from
`git revert --reference` or `revert.reference=true`; `, reversing` for the revert of a
merge, `git revert -m N`), the id naming one commit, over the tree `git revert` makes of
that commit (the same merge, by `git merge-tree`: the reverted lines come back where they
were, and a file renamed since is followed). Any other commit that opens with those words is
judged like every commit, and so is a revert whose conflicts were resolved by hand, one that
names a commit of another branch, and one whose named commit a rebase has since replaced
(the message still names the old id). git does not tell `commit-msg` that a commit is an
amend, so an amend of a merge or revert is refused there, reworded or not: amend one with
`git commit --amend --no-verify` (commit-lint skips merges).

## The rules file

The type list, the scope and `Stack:` patterns, the length limits and the trailer order live in
one file, `.githooks/commit-rules`, which `commit-msg`, `.harness/scripts/acommit.sh` and the commit template
all read. Names such as `COMMIT_TYPES` below are its variables; this document does not repeat
their values, so there is one place to change a rule and no copy to forget.

The two length limits are the exception to "in that file": `COMMIT_HEADER_MAX` and
`COMMIT_BODY_MAX` are written once, in `lib.limits` in `flake.nix`, with the Python line length.
`nix run .#gen-config` writes them to `.githooks/commit-limits`, which `commit-rules` sources,
and writes `.editorconfig` and `.harness/quality/ruff-limits.toml` from the same numbers. The generated
files stay committed, for a clone without Nix, and `make check` and `make gates` fail when one
differs from the flake or is gone; the hooks refuse to run on a limits file that is missing or
not a positive integer, naming `nix run .#gen-config`. To change a limit, change it in `flake.nix`
and run the generator.

## Writing a message by hand

A plain `git commit` opens an editor on a message that is not empty: `.githooks/prepare-commit-msg`
fills it with the header skeleton `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`, the trailers that can be known
(`Stack:` from the branch, derived as `.harness/scripts/acommit.sh` derives it, and `Human-Only: true` where
no agent identity is set), and the rules above as comment lines, also under `git commit -v`
(the diff below the scissors line is git's, not a message). The rules do not end up in the
commit: they are written where git strips them, whatever `core.commentChar`, `core.commentString`
and `commit.cleanup` are (below the scissors line when git wrote one, as comments otherwise; under
`commit.cleanup=whitespace` or `verbatim`, which keep comments, they are not written at all). A
`--cleanup=whitespace` or `verbatim` on the command line reaches no hook, so `commit-msg` takes
out the block `prepare-commit-msg` wrote and recorded for this commit, which ends in a marker
line with a random id; a quotation of the rules that you write is not that block, and stays.
git's own status comments stay, as that mode keeps them, and a commit that also skips
`commit-msg` (`--no-verify`) keeps the rules too.
`.harness/scripts/setup.sh` sets `commit.cleanup=scissors`. A header that is still the skeleton is refused
(`skeleton`), spaces around a placeholder included. The hook acts only on an empty message: `-m`,
`-F` (which `.harness/scripts/acommit.sh` uses), a merge, a squash and an amend carry a message already and
are left alone.

**[gate]** `commit-msg` judges the message as git will store it, so it applies git's own cleanup
first: `commit.cleanup` if set, else strip when an editor was used and whitespace when not
(`-m`, `-F`, `-C`), with the comment prefix git uses. The status block git appends for the
person is not judged; the lines of a message git keeps as written are. Two things are not visible
to a hook: a `--cleanup=` option on the command line, and an editor that is literally `:`. The hook
reads the config, and an editor of `:` as no editor, so its comment lines are judged; the stored
message is judged again by `commit-lint` on push. Under the deprecated `core.commentChar=auto`
git picks the prefix before the editor opens and tells no hook: `commit-msg` knows it only where
`prepare-commit-msg` filled an empty message and recorded it, and elsewhere takes no line for a
comment.

A refusal names the id of the rule that fired, the part that fails (`unknown type 'doc': did you
mean 'docs'?`, `scope must be lowercase: README -> readme`, `summary must start lower-case: Upper ->
upper`), and what to do. In hook mode it also prints the command that brings the typed message back
into the editor. git keeps it in `COMMIT_EDITMSG` until the next commit (measured for a plain
commit, `-a`, a pathspec, `--amend`, `-m`, `-F` and `-e -F`), so there is no copy:

```
git commit -e -F "$(git rev-parse --git-path COMMIT_EDITMSG)"
```

Where what was meant is not in doubt, the hook corrects it instead of refusing: a known trailer key
to its canonical spelling (`Human-only` to `Human-Only`), and a type or scope to lower case when the
result is an allowed type and a valid scope. It writes the corrected message into the file git
commits, and **scolds** for each correction, saying how often that kind has been needed in this
clone: tolerated input becomes a standard nobody wrote (RFC 9413), so the hook keeps count. The count
is the log `commit-msg-tolerated.log` in the git directory (date, kind, from, to). Anything that
needs a guess (an unknown type, a scope with a space) is refused, untouched. `commit-lint` edits
nothing: there a trailer key that differs from the canonical one in case only is accepted as that
key, so landed history is not refused for case alone; a type or scope in the wrong case is refused.

## Message format

```
<type>(<scope>)<!?>: <summary>
                                  <- exactly one blank line
<body>
                                  <- exactly one blank line
<trailer block>
```

### Header — one line

- **[gate] length** — the whole line is at most `COMMIT_HEADER_MAX` characters.
- **[gate] type** ∈ `COMMIT_TYPES`.
- **[gate] scope** — present, in parens, lower-case, matching `COMMIT_SCOPE_CHARS`. A noun for the touched area. Harness
  scopes: `harness` `docs` `stack` `conventions` `commits` `workflow` `worktree` `hooks`
  `commands` `agents` `skill` `scripts`. Worktree scopes: `grammar` `parser` `desugar` `core`
  `eval` `types` `errors` `driver` `repl`, or a `features/<name>` name.
- **[gate] `!`** before the `:` iff breaking; also add a `BREAKING-CHANGE:` trailer.
- **[gate] summary** follows `: ` directly, starts lower-case, no trailing period.
- **[advisory] summary** in the imperative ("add", not "adds"/"added").

### Body — required unless the change is trivially self-evident

- **[gate]** exactly one blank line between header and body.
- **[gate]** lines ≤ `COMMIT_BODY_MAX` columns. Exceptions the hook allows: fenced code blocks, table rows
  (`| … |`), and a line with no break opportunity past that column (a long URL or path).
- **[advisory]** content is *why*: the problem, motivation, constraints, alternatives
  rejected — never a narration of the diff. Reference decisions by file (`.agents/STACK.md`).

### Trailer block

- **[gate]** one blank line before it; each line `Token: value`, tokens use `-` for spaces.
  It is the message's last paragraph, read as `git interpret-trailers --parse` reads it (all
  trailers, or a quarter of them beside prose when one is a `Signed-off-by:`); a line that
  looks like a trailer anywhere else is body text, and counts for no gate below. Keys are read
  without regard to case, as git reads them: `stack:` is a `Stack:`.
- **[gate]** `Assisted-By` **and** `Session-Id` are both present — **or** a single
  `Human-Only: true` line for a hand-made human commit, never both.
- **[gate]** on a stack branch — `stack/<name>[/<part>]`, or the same under `agent/<id>/`
  (`.agents/BRANCHES.md`) — the message carries `Stack: <name>`; a message holds at most one
  `Stack:`, and its value is always `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*`. `.harness/scripts/acommit.sh` derives it
  from the branch (`-K <name>` overrides). Stack refs are deleted after landing and a linear
  landing leaves no merge commit, so this trailer is the in-repo record of which commits formed
  one unit: `git log --grep='^Stack: typed-let$'` recovers the stack years later, forge or no
  forge.
- `.harness/scripts/acommit.sh` takes the session id from `-S <id>`, else `$FPL_SESSION_ID`, else
  `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, and refuses to commit when none is set — any harness can
  export `FPL_SESSION_ID`. It never invents one: a made-up id is useless for forensics.
- **[gate]** known trailers appear in the order of `COMMIT_TRAILER_ORDER`:

  | Trailer | Meaning | Example |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `Refs` | path / issue / feature this commit serves (repeatable) | `Refs: .agents/STACK.md` |
  | `Stack` | the stack this commit landed as part of (`.agents/WORKFLOW.md`) | `Stack: typed-let` |
  | `BREAKING-CHANGE` | required iff `!` in header | `BREAKING-CHANGE: core drops Let node` |
  | `Advisor` | an external model whose output informed the change (repeatable) | `Advisor: fable-5.1` |
  | `Assisted-By` | the model that produced the change, stable slug | `Assisted-By: claude-sonnet-5` |
  | `Reasoning-Effort` | that model's reasoning-effort setting | `Reasoning-Effort: low` |
  | `Session-Id` | the agent session id, for forensics | `Session-Id: d94ffb13-…` |
  | `Co-Authored-By` | co-author, GitHub-parseable form (repeatable) | `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>` |

## Atomicity

- **[gate, soft]** `.githooks/atomic-check` sends the staged diff + message to a cheap model
  (Haiku) and blocks a commit the model judges to bundle unrelated concerns. It is a *soft*
  verifier — weaker than the symbolic gates — so it **fails open**: any infrastructure problem
  (no model reachable, unparseable reply) skips the check rather than blocking.
  - `FPL_ATOMIC_GATE=block` (default) · `warn` (print, don't block) · `off` (skip).
  - `FPL_ATOMIC_STRICT=1` also blocks when the model could not be reached.
  - Verdicts are cached under `.git/atomic-cache/` keyed on tree+message, so `--amend` loops
    don't re-bill. Cost is one Haiku call (~seconds) per distinct staged state.
- **[advisory]** one logical change per commit; stage at **hunk** level (`git add -p`) so a
  commit never bundles unrelated edits. New files are one hunk by nature.

## Authorship

Two identities, deliberately kept apart.

### 1. Local (terminal-session) commits — a GitHub machine account

- **[gate] author** = `<model display name> <machine-account email>`, e.g.
  `Claude Sonnet 5 <NNNNN+psjg-claude@users.noreply.github.com>`.
  - The **name carries the model** (`Claude Sonnet 5`, `Claude Opus 5`, `Claude Haiku 4.5`, …)
    so `git shortlog -sn` shows at a glance who committed what.
  - The **email is one constant address** — the GitHub noreply of a dedicated machine account
    (a normal GitHub login made for automation, *not* a Unix account) — so every model still
    links to a single contributor on the forge.
  - `.githooks/commit-msg` rejects a non-`Human-Only` commit whose author email is not the one
    in `.git/agent-identity`.
- **committer** stays whoever ran the session (their normal `git config user.*`).
- **[gate] agent territory** — a commit that is not `Human-Only` sits on an agent branch:
  `agent/<id>/…`, or the flat vendor form `<id>/<slug>` (`.agents/BRANCHES.md`). The branch's
  `<id>` names its lead, not an exclusive author, so it is not compared with `Assisted-By`:
  a Codex commit on a Claude-led branch is legal and attributed by its own author name and
  trailers. Human commits on agent branches are legal too. `FPL_BRANCH_GATE=warn` overrides.
- Set up once per clone/worktree:

  ```
  .harness/scripts/agent-identity.sh set "NNNNN+psjg-claude@users.noreply.github.com"
  ```

  This writes `.git/agent-identity` (inside `.git/`, per-worktree, never committed).
  `.harness/scripts/acommit.sh` reads it and refuses to commit if it is unset.

### 2. Forge-originated work — the Claude GitHub App

CI runs and `@claude` interactions on issues/PRs are authored by the **`claude[bot]`** account
(the [Claude GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude), installed on this repo). Different
email, independent identity — no collision, no impersonation either way.

`.github/workflows/claude.yml` wires the hooks in the App's runner before it starts
(`.harness/scripts/setup.sh`, and `.harness/scripts/agent-identity.sh set` with the bot's own address), so a commit
it makes there meets the same `commit-msg` as one made in a terminal. It commits with
`.harness/scripts/acommit.sh`: the author name carries its model, `Session-Id` is `gha-<run id>` and
leads back to the Actions run. `.harness/scripts/commit-lint.sh` holds its commits to every gate; the
App's address is one of the accepted agent addresses (the workflow's list, mirrored in
`.github/agent-emails`).

GitHub links a commit to an account by matching the author/co-author **email** to one
registered on that account. `noreply@anthropic.com` is not a forge account, so a bare
`Co-Authored-By: Claude …` line is provenance only, never a contributor-graph entry — hence
the machine account.

## Example

```
docs(stack): record settled implementation stack decision

The stack was chosen with the maintainer after consulting two external
advisors and must survive across worktrees and sessions without being
reopened each time. Recording the decision and its rejected alternatives
makes "why Python and not OCaml" answerable from the log alone.
