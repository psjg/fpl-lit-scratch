# QUALITY.md — the noslop gate

An implementation worktree is done when `make check` is green (AGENTS.md). This file says what
that gate runs, why each check is in it, and how its strictness is kept out of reach of the
code it judges. The harness side lives in `.harness/quality/` and `.harness/scripts/` at the root; the project
it judges is the walker in `01-bootstrap/`, whose `Makefile` is one line, `include
../.harness/quality/noslop.mk`. The root's `Makefile` runs each lane there, so `make check` from the
root is the gate; the lanes run in `01-bootstrap/` and use the one `.venv` at the root.

The checks are aimed at the ways agent-written code goes wrong without failing a test: code
nobody runs, tests that run code without checking it, branches that pile up, layers that leak
into each other, and quiet waivers. Several come from Robert C. Martin's 2026 practice of
putting agents under CRAP, mutation testing and dependency rules; the rest are the standard
Python tools for the same jobs.

## The lanes

```
make fix      ruff's safe fixes, then the formatter
make quick    lint, format, tests; stops at the first failure. Seconds. The inner loop.
make check    the one gate. Green means done.
make harden   check, then the long search: 20x the examples, CrossHair on every property
              and every contract, mutation testing
make ready    harden, then gates, then a known-vulnerability audit of the pinned tools
make gates    proof that each check still refuses a bad example, and the harness's own lint
make tools    the tooling beside the language, .harness/tools/<name>/, judged as strictly (see Tools)
make map      the map of the code, never committed (below); no other lane runs it
```

Beside the lanes, the root's `Makefile` has the walker's entry, which is not a gate:

```
make run FILE=f   run the file f, a path from the root
make repl ARGS=a  the REPL (python -m fpl.repl a)
```

The package is `01-bootstrap/fpl`, so a bare `python -m fpl` from the root finds no module; both
targets put `01-bootstrap/` on the path of the one `.venv`'s python. A console script was
weighed and left: it needs a build backend in `01-bootstrap/pyproject.toml` and the walker
installed into `.harness/quality/`'s locked environment, a policy change for the same reach.

The same lanes run on the forge (`.github/workflows/noslop.yml`): `make check` on every push
to a pull request, `make ready` once it is out of draft and on every push to `main`. A
harness-only branch, which has no code to judge, runs `make gates` from the root instead:
`make -f .harness/quality/noslop.mk gates`. The runner enters the dev shell of `flake.nix`, so it judges
with the tools a laptop has.

`make map` is a view, not a check. `.harness/scripts/diagrams` draws the import graph of the root
package `.harness/quality/importlinter.ini` names, found in the directory the script's `SOURCE`
names, with import-linter's own verdict on each contract of that file, the verdict
lint-imports gives in `make check`, and a class diagram per module, as Mermaid, into
`.noslop/map/`.
Its output is never committed: computed from the code each time, it cannot go stale.
`.github/workflows/map.yml` draws the head and the base of every pull request into the run's
summary, with the difference between the two. Each checkout is drawn where its own
`.harness/scripts/diagrams` says its package lies, read without running it, so the base of a pull
request that moves the package is drawn where the package was.

`make check` runs, in order:

| Check | Refuses |
| --- | --- |
| `ruff-limits` | a `.harness/quality/ruff-limits.toml` that sets no `line-length`, which would give ruff its default of 88; every lane that runs ruff checks it first |
| `pristine` | an uncommitted change to a policy file (below) |
| `config-fresh` | a file generated from `lib.limits` in `flake.nix` (`.editorconfig`, `.harness/quality/ruff-limits.toml`, `.githooks/commit-limits`) that differs from the flake or is gone; the remedy is `nix run .#gen-config` |
| `ruff check`, `ruff format --check` | lint findings, including cyclomatic complexity over 8 (`.harness/quality/ruff.toml`); unformatted code |
| `pyright`, strict | anything strict mode refuses, and a `match` that misses a case (`.harness/quality/pyright.json`) |
| `mypy`, strict | the same code as the reference implementation of the typing PEPs reads it, with unreachable code and unused ignores as errors (`.harness/quality/mypy.ini`) |
| `.harness/scripts/escapes` | a waiver that does not name its rule and give a reason |
| `.harness/scripts/props` | a module with code that no property test imports |
| `pytest` under `coverage` | a failing test; less than 100% line and branch coverage (`.harness/quality/coveragerc`) |
| `.harness/scripts/crap` | a function whose CRAP score is over 8 (`.harness/quality/crap.toml`) |
| `lint-imports` | an import that crosses the layering of CONVENTIONS.md (`.harness/quality/importlinter.ini`) |
| `deptry` | an import of a package `pyproject.toml` does not declare, or a declared one nobody imports |
| `vulture` | code nothing uses |
| `pylint` duplicate-code | six or more lines repeated |
| `make run` from the root | the entry a README points to failing, or printing other than the `.expected` of `03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/draft2/examples/01-frames` (the lanes run in `01-bootstrap/`, so only this step runs the walker from the root) |

On the milestone-0 skeleton `make check` takes about 6 seconds and `make harden` about 3
minutes, almost all of it CrossHair.

## Tools

Tooling that serves the language without being part of it, a page that shows how tokenizers
cut FPL source say, lives under `.harness/tools/<name>/`: each a uv project of its own, with its own
`pyproject.toml`, lock, `pyright.json` and `coveragerc`, so its dependencies never enter the
environment the language is judged in. `make tools` (from the root, `make -f
.harness/quality/noslop.mk tools`) judges every such directory with the gate's own strictness: ruff
under `.harness/quality/ruff.toml`, pyright strict, mypy under `.harness/quality/mypy.ini`, the waiver check of
`.harness/scripts/escapes`, and its tests, with the harness's Hypothesis profiles, at 100% line and
branch coverage.

It is a lane apart. `check`, `quick`, `harden`, `ready` and `gates` do not depend on it, and
deptry in `check` excludes `.harness/tools/`, so the inner loop of the language never waits on a
tool's environment or reads a tool's imports. On the forge it runs from
`.github/workflows/tools.yml`, only when `.harness/tools/` or the policy that judges it changes.

## CRAP

CRAP(m) = C²(1 − p)³ + C, with C the cyclomatic complexity of function m and p the share of its
lines and branches the tests run. `.harness/scripts/crap` computes it from radon's complexity and
coverage.py's branch data, counting only a function's body, since its `def` line runs on
import. A function over 8 fails, and so does one the coverage report does not know.

With coverage at 100% CRAP equals C, so in practice the limit is a complexity limit of 8, which
ruff also enforces. The CRAP gate matters when coverage slips, and even then it is lenient:
complexity 5 with four of its branches untested scores 7.6 and passes. Coverage at 100% is what
bites first. Martin found that a hard complexity limit makes an agent split functions into
pieces that only pass their arguments along; `.harness/scripts/crap` counts those one-call wrappers in
its report, and does not refuse them.

## Properties

Every module with code needs a test that imports it and uses Hypothesis's `@given`. Which
properties it states is the author's to judge; that there is one is not optional. The profiles
are in `.harness/quality/noslop_pytest.py`, loaded by every test run:

- `quick`, 100 examples per property: `make quick` and `make check`.
- `harden`, 2000 examples: `make harden`.
- `symbolic`, the same properties handed to CrossHair, which solves for inputs that reach each
  branch instead of drawing them at random: `make harden`. 50 examples; CrossHair spends up to
  2.5 s per path, so a property that runs deep into Lark costs most of the budget.

On Linux, CrossHair's solver needs libstdc++ on the loader path; the dev shell sets it
(.agents/DEVSHELL.md), and `make harden` stops with a message if it does not load.

## Contracts

A function may state what it needs and what it promises with icontract:

```python
def inside(result: Span, source: str) -> bool:
    ...

@icontract.require(reported)
@icontract.ensure(inside)
def where(source: str, line: int, column: int) -> Span:
```

The predicates are named, typed functions, not lambdas: strict pyright refuses a lambda's
unknown parameters, and a name says what is promised. icontract checks them on every call,
so a test that reaches the function checks its contract too, and mutation testing sees a
contract as another way a mutant gets killed. `make harden` then runs `crosshair check` over
the `fpl` package with the icontract kind: for each contract it solves for an input that breaks it, up
to `CONTRACT_SECONDS` of CPU per condition, and reports the call. That is the difference
from a property test: a property is checked on the inputs Hypothesis draws, a contract on
the inputs a solver finds, and `where()` above was refuted at the end of a line before any
test drew that case.

A precondition is part of the contract, not a way out of it: `reported` says what Lark
delivers, so the solver does not spend its budget on positions Lark never gives. It is
tested through the callers that satisfy it.

## Metatheory

A language has properties its implementation must keep. They are stated as properties, under
Hypothesis in `make check` and CrossHair in `make harden`, and each is due from the moment
the module it concerns has code. `.harness/quality/obligations.toml` lists them per module;
`.harness/scripts/props` fails a module with code whose obligation no property test pays, and a test
pays one by naming it:

```python
@pytest.mark.obligation("desugaring preserves meaning")
@given(programs())
def test_evaluating_the_core_gives_what_the_surface_gives(program: str) -> None:
```

The obligations:

- `parse.py`: every program the grammar derives (`hypothesis.extra.lark.from_lark`) parses
  without an Earley ambiguity, not only the example corpus.
- `desugar.py`: desugaring preserves meaning: evaluating a surface program and evaluating
  its core translation give the same result, for programs derived from the grammar.
- `ast_surface.py` and `ast_core.py`, once there is a printer: print then parse is the
  identity on the AST.
- `types.py`: progress and preservation: a well-typed core term is a value or takes a
  step, and the step keeps its type.
- The backend, when it exists: the interpreter and the compiled program print the same
  output for every conformance example and for derived programs.

These are the tests that make the layered frontend of .agents/STACK.md more than a layout. The
two that wait on a module that does not exist yet (a printer, a backend) are noted in the
file and not owed by anyone until it does.

## Mutants

`.harness/scripts/mutants` runs mutmut: it changes the code one small way at a time (`<` to `<=`, a
string to another, an argument to `None`) and runs the tests against each change. A mutant the
tests do not catch has survived: the line it changed runs, but nothing checks what it does.
Every mutant that is not killed fails `make harden`, unless `01-bootstrap/mutants.allow` names
it with a reason:

```
fpl.parse.x_where__mutmut_3 -- equivalent: column 0 and column 1 print the same caret
```

The file is for equivalent mutants, which no test can kill. An entry without a reason is
refused; one whose mutant no longer lives is reported. A run that lists no mutants at all fails.

## Waivers

Every way out of a check names what it waives and says why, after ` -- `:

```
# noqa: E731 -- <reason>
# pyright: ignore[reportUnknownMemberType] -- <reason>
# type: ignore[arg-type] -- <reason>
# pragma: no cover -- <reason>
```

`# type: ignore` is mypy's form and waives mypy alone: pyright is configured not to honour it
(`enableTypeIgnoreComments: false`), so a line that both checkers refuse carries two waivers,
each with its reason. A bare `# type: ignore` is refused.

## Policy

The gate is only as strict as the files that configure it, and an agent that can edit them in
the same commit as its code can make any code pass. So:

- `.harness/quality/` and `.harness/scripts/` are harness. A commit that touches them touches no implementation
  path (`.harness/scripts/boundary.sh`, judged by `.harness/scripts/commit-lint.sh` at push and in CI), so such a
  change is a commit of its own, made from any checkout.
- `.harness/quality/`, and the `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile` and `mutants.allow` of the root and of
  `01-bootstrap/`, are policy. A commit that changes one carries the marker `[policy]` in its
  message and touches no code or tests (the `fpl` package and its tests, at the root or in
  `01-bootstrap/`; `.githooks/commit-msg`), so the change is reviewed on its own.
- The gate judges only committed policy: `make check` stops when any policy file, or
  `.harness/scripts/`, differs from what is committed, and also when git cannot say.
- The examples under `03-fpl/OLD/03.01-features/*/examples/` are oracle, like `spec.md`: `[spec]` and the
  `guard-specs` hook (AGENTS.md, "The oracle rule").

The tools and their versions are pinned in `.harness/quality/uv.lock`. `make` syncs them into the
root's `.venv` with `uv sync --frozen` the first time and whenever the lock changes.

## Proof that the checks bite

A check that passes everything looks the same as a check that found nothing. `make gates` first
holds the harness's own Python (`.harness/scripts/crap`, `props`, `escapes`, `mutants`, `gates`,
`forward-only`, `diagrams` and the pytest plugin) to the ruff rules it holds others to, then
runs the self-tests of the six of those scripts that have one, of `.harness/scripts/leak-check.sh`, of the
pre-push hook and of `.harness/scripts/boundary.sh`, then
`.harness/scripts/gates`: for each case in `.harness/quality/bad/`, the check runs on a small fixture of the
repository (the harness at its root, a project in `01-bootstrap/`), where it must pass, and then with the case's bad example laid over it, where it must fail with a
given message. The first run is the control; without it, a check that fails for an unrelated
reason would count as having caught something. Adding a check means adding its case.
