"""Hard wrapping of FPL comments, never of code.

A trailing `<tab>; note` that runs past the width continues on lone `;`
lines at the code's indentation; a `;;`, `;;;` or `;;;;` line wraps with
its own marker repeated. Code has no continuation form, so a code line
past the width stays as it is and is counted as over. Ventilating cuts
every note and comment line at sentence ends instead of at a width.
