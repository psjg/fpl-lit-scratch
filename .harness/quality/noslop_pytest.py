""".harness/quality/noslop_pytest.py — the pytest plugin every implementation
worktree loads.

Hypothesis profiles, chosen with HYPOTHESIS_PROFILE: `quick` for the
inner loop and `make check`; `harden` for `make harden`, which searches
far longer for a counterexample; and `symbolic`, also in `make harden`,
which hands the same properties to CrossHair: instead of drawing random
inputs it solves for inputs that reach each branch, so it finds the one
value in a billion that random search does not. Kept in the harness so
an attempt cannot quietly shrink how hard its properties are searched.
