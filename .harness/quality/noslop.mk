# .harness/quality/noslop.mk — the noslop harness's lanes. A project's Makefile is one line, `include
# ../.harness/quality/noslop.mk` (01-bootstrap/Makefile); everything the gate runs, and how hard, lives
# here, in the root's shared harness, so a project cannot loosen its own gate
# (.agents/QUALITY.md). The lanes run in the project's directory, 01-bootstrap/, a child of the
# root; the harness's .harness/quality/ and .harness/scripts/ and the one .venv are the root's. The root's
# Makefile runs each lane there, and `make -f .harness/quality/noslop.mk gates` runs at the root.
#
#   make fix      rewrite what can be rewritten: ruff's safe fixes, then the formatter
#   make quick    the inner loop, seconds: lint, format, and the tests, stopping at the first
#   make check    the one gate; green here means done (AGENTS.md). It begins by refusing config
#                 files that differ from what flake.nix's lib.limits generates, and its last
#                 step runs one example from the root, through the entry a README points to
#                 (make run)
#   make harden   the long search: 20x the examples, CrossHair on every property and every
#                 contract, mutants
#   make ready    check + harden + gates + a known-vulnerability audit + nix flake check; before
#                 a PR leaves draft
#   make gates    proof that each check still bites: the harness's own lint, its self-tests,
#                 and a bad example each check refuses; also that the files generated from
#                 flake.nix's lib.limits are current. Also what the root runs, where there
#                 is no code to judge: make -f .harness/quality/noslop.mk gates
#   make tools    the tooling beside the language: every .harness/tools/<name>/ that holds a
#                 pyproject.toml, a uv project of its own, judged as strictly as the code.
#                 Reached only by name, so no other lane waits on it
#   make map      the map of the code, imports and classes, drawn into .noslop/map/ and never
#                 committed; no other lane runs it (.harness/scripts/diagrams)
