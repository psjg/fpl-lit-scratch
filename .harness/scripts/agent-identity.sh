# .harness/scripts/agent-identity.sh — read / write the agent author email for this worktree.
#
# The value lives in `.git/agent-identity` (one line, an email address). It is
# inside .git/, so it is per-worktree and never committed. `.harness/scripts/acommit.sh`
# reads it to build `--author="<model display name> <email>"`; see .agents/COMMITS.md.
#
# Only the email is stored. The author *name* is derived per-commit from the model
# that is running, so `git shortlog -sn` distinguishes "Claude Sonnet 5" from
# "Claude Opus 5" while both link to one GitHub machine account via the email.
#
# Usage:
#   .harness/scripts/agent-identity.sh show           # print the email, exit 1 if unset
#   .harness/scripts/agent-identity.sh set <email>    # store the email
#   .harness/scripts/agent-identity.sh path           # print the file path
