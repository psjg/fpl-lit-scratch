# .harness/scripts/land.sh — the maintainer's half of landing a pull request: wait, look, decide.
#
#   .harness/scripts/land.sh                   the pull request of the current branch
#   .harness/scripts/land.sh <number | url>
#
# Waits for the checks, prints the conversation, opens the diff in the browser, and then
# stops for a keypress. Only after Enter does it approve, rebase-merge, delete the branch
# and bring main up to date (.agents/WORKFLOW.md, "Land"). A failed check ends it before
# the question.
#
# It exists because a chain of gh commands made it easy to approve a diff that had never
# been on screen. It is for a person: it refuses without a terminal, and it refuses when
# the active gh account is the author of the request, which the forge would reject
# anyway. It is a rail, not a lock: whoever can run gh as the maintainer can approve
# without it. Needs gh: `.harness/scripts/layer.sh on github`.
