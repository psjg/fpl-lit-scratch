#   .harness/scripts/review.sh -b <base> …      against another base (the branch below, in a stack)
#   .harness/scripts/review.sh -s               side by side instead of one column
#   .harness/scripts/review.sh -o <file>        write the page there and do not open it
#   .harness/scripts/review.sh --serve          stop a running page, import the open pull requests,
#                                   and serve the Radicle patches with their comments and
#                                   a page to add yours (.harness/scripts/review-serve --fresh)

# A forge shows a hunk and a few lines around it, and folds the rest away. A hunk is
# not reviewable on its own: whether a variable already exists, whether `set -e` bites
# here, whether the line above reverses the meaning — none of that is in the hunk. So
# this renders every changed file whole, and opens it in the browser.
#
# It reads git refs and nothing else: no forge, no network, no account. It works on a
# branch that was never pushed, and it keeps working if the forge changes.
