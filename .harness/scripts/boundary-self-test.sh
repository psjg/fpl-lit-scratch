# .harness/scripts/boundary-self-test.sh — proof that .harness/scripts/boundary.sh judges one commit by its own paths,

#   judged directly   either side alone, neutral paths with either, the near misses of each
#                     root, renames within and across, deletions, a root commit, names with
#                     [x], *, a blank, a leading dash and a newline, and names that are not
#                     UTF-8 under a UTF-8 locale, an inherited nocasematch, a replacement
#                     object: pure passes, mixed is refused (BOUNDARY-MIXED) with a bounded
#                     list of each side
#   the remedy        run as printed, for a tip, a deeper commit, a root commit, odd names, a
#                     rename across, a merge after it, an evil merge, an implementation
#                     directory replaced by a neutral file and 2000 paths: two one-sided
#                     commits, the mixed commit's tree, the branch's tree, merges and checkout
#                     unchanged; staged, unstaged and ignored local files kept; a stacked
#                     branch left where it was under rebase.updateRefs, and given the same
#                     commits when split the same way; the printed undo puts the branch back
#   fails closed      a git that exits 2, a diff-tree that fails, a bad revision, a merge,
#                     no arguments, a TMPDIR that takes no directory, a --split without a
#                     branch or with one that lacks the commit, a branch that moves during the
#                     split (left where it moved to), a shallow clone, a grafts file, a symbolic
#                     branch (and one that turns symbolic during the split: the branch it points
#                     at does not move), a merge carrying a mergetag header: BOUNDARY-TOOL, a
#                     remedy line and exit 2
#   warns             notes on rewritten commits are named and not copied; a commit a
#                     remote-tracking ref holds is called published, in the refusal and in the
#                     split, which still runs
#   commit-lint       a range that starts before .harness/scripts/boundary.sh existed
#   pre-push          a mixed commit made by commit (no gate at commit time), --no-verify,
#                     cherry-pick and commit --amend is refused, as is a name that is not
#                     UTF-8 pushed under a UTF-8 locale; pure ones go; the remedy
#                     printed by the refused push, run as printed, lets the push go
#
# Each run counts the pure cases refused (wanted: none) and the mixed cases refused (wanted:
# all). Everything happens in throwaway repositories, with Git's global and system config,
# HOME and XDG_CONFIG_HOME pointed away from the maintainer's; the leak gate (a self-test of
# its own) and the LLM atomicity gate are off there.
#
# The suite runs once per bash: a bash >= 5 first on PATH (the dev shell's, CI's), and on a
# Mac also /bin/bash 3.2, which a push from outside the dev shell gets. Either missing fails
# the test; on Linux, 3.2 is not covered, and the run says so.
