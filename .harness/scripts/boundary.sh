# .harness/scripts/boundary.sh — one commit holds harness paths or implementation paths, never both.
#
#   .harness/scripts/boundary.sh <commit> [<branch>]          judge the commit
#   .harness/scripts/boundary.sh --split <commit> <branch>    split a mixed commit of <branch> in two
#
# AGENTS.md and .agents/WORKTREES.md split the repository in two, reviewed and landed apart:
#
#   harness         02-docs/ .agents/ .claude/ .harness/ .githooks/ AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
#                   flake.nix flake.lock .envrc
#   implementation  01-bootstrap/ features/ 03-fpl/ tests/ pyproject.toml Makefile mutants.allow
#                   (fpl/ stays implementation for good: after the move to 01-bootstrap/ it is
#                   FPL's own tree)
#
# Every other path (README.md, .gitignore, .github/, LICENSE, ...) is neutral and goes
# with either side. Any checkout may hold any work; what is judged is the commit.
#
# The commit is compared with its parent, a root commit with the empty tree, with rename
# detection; both paths of a rename count. So fpl/x -> 01-bootstrap/fpl/x stays on one side and
# docs/x -> 01-bootstrap/x is mixed. As both ends count, the verdict is the same whether git finds
# the rename or shows a delete and an add.
#
# .harness/scripts/commit-lint.sh runs this for every non-merge commit of a range, with the checker of the
# checkout that runs it, never the judged commit's, so a range from before this script existed
# is judged too. commit-lint runs in pre-push and in CI, which makes the rule bind whatever
# made the commit: commit, cherry-pick, rebase, amend, --no-verify, an unwired clone, jj.
# A merge is not judged here; commit-lint skips merges, and main's ruleset requires a linear
# history, so a merge commit cannot land. A squash merge could fold one-sided commits into one
# mixed commit that nothing judges; .agents/WORKTREES.md says why landing is by rebase only.
#
# Rules, each printed with what clears it:
#
#   BOUNDARY-MIXED  the commit changes harness and implementation paths       exit 1
#   BOUNDARY-TOOL   a git command failed, the arguments are wrong, or the     exit 2
#                   history cannot be trusted (shallow, grafts, a symbolic branch,
#                   a mergetag to rebuild): refused, never read as clean
#
# The refusal lists a few paths of each side and a count, and prints the --split command for
# the commit and <branch>: the given branch, else the checked-out one, if it holds the commit.
# Every argument is printed with printf %q. Paths are read NUL-separated and judged with
# bash's own regex in the C locale: a name holding a newline is one name, and a name that is
# not UTF-8 is judged by its bytes. The commit's own bytes are judged, never a replacement
# object's, and a caller's nocasematch is switched off. Parents are read from the commit's own
# header, and a shallow repository or a grafts file is refused: git would show the commit
# another ancestry than the one it holds.
#
# --split builds the two halves from trees, never from a checkout: the harness half is the
# commit's tree with the implementation paths of its parent, the implementation half is the
# commit's tree. Both carry the commit's author, committer and message. Each later commit of
# <branch> is rebuilt on the new parents with its own tree, author, committer and message, so
# merges, evil ones included, stay as they were, and the branch's tree does not change. Then
# <branch>, and only <branch>, moves by compare-and-swap; the work tree, the index and every
# other ref (a branch stacked on the commit too) are left alone, so ignored and uncommitted
# local files stay. A neutral path that collides with an implementation path of the parent (a
# file tests replacing the directory tests/) goes with the implementation half. A signature
# is not carried over: it no longer matches. A symbolic <branch> is refused (update-ref would
# move the branch it points at; the move and the printed undo use --no-deref), and so is a
# history in which a rebuilt commit carries a mergetag header, which would name a commit that
# is no longer a parent. Notes on rewritten commits stay where they are: the split names them
# and copies none. When a remote-tracking ref holds the commit, the refusal and the split both
# say that pushing the result rewrites a published branch. .harness/scripts/boundary-self-test.sh proves
# each case, under bash 3.2 and 5.
