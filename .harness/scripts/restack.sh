# .harness/scripts/restack.sh — rebase the current stack onto the latest base, moving every
# branch ref in the stack with it.
#
# This is the whole "restack" step from .agents/WORKFLOW.md. It relies on
# rebase.updateRefs=true (set by .harness/scripts/setup.sh) so intermediate branch refs that
# point at commits in the stack are carried along instead of left behind.
#
# Usage:
#   .harness/scripts/restack.sh              # fetch, rebase HEAD onto the upstream of <base>
#   .harness/scripts/restack.sh <base>       # use a different base branch (default: main)
#   .harness/scripts/restack.sh --continue   # after resolving conflicts
#   .harness/scripts/restack.sh --abort
