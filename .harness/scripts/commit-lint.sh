# .harness/scripts/commit-lint.sh — run the commit-msg gates over commits that already exist.
#
#   .harness/scripts/commit-lint.sh github/main..HEAD
#   .harness/scripts/commit-lint.sh -b agent/claude/stack/x github/main..HEAD
#   .harness/scripts/commit-lint.sh -b agent/claude/stack/x HEAD ^<sha> ^<sha>    (what pre-push hands it)
#
# .githooks/commit-msg judges a commit while it is being made, and only in a clone whose
# hooks are wired, with a tool that runs hooks. `git commit --no-verify`, an unwired clone
# and jj (.agents/JJ.md) all get past it. This runs the same hook, in its lint mode, over a
# revision range, or any rev-list arguments, so the forge can judge every commit of a pull
# request (.github/workflows/commit-lint.yml) and anyone can do the same before pushing.
#
# Each commit is also judged by .harness/scripts/boundary.sh: it changes harness paths or implementation
# paths, never both (.agents/WORKTREES.md). Like the hook, the checker is this checkout's, never
# the judged commit's, so a range from before .harness/scripts/boundary.sh existed is judged all the same.
# Nothing switches it off. Merges are skipped (--no-merges), by both: main's ruleset requires
# a linear history, so a merge commit cannot land, and the commits it brings are in the range.
# A squash merge is the one landing no commit-lint sees (.agents/WORKTREES.md).
#
#   -b BRANCH   the branch the commits are headed for review on. With it, gate 8 wants
#               the matching 'Stack:' trailer and gate 9 wants an agent branch for agent
#               commits. Without it those two comparisons are skipped, which is what you
#               want for a range of main.
#
# Agent commits may be authored by .git/agent-identity or by an accepted agent address.
# Which addresses are accepted depends on who runs this:
#   FPL_AGENT_EMAILS set (CI: the workflow sets it inline)   that list, space-separated, is
#               the only one. .github/agent-emails comes from the tree under judgment, so a
#               pull request could add its own author there; it is never read into the
#               list. An address in it that the list lacks is refused, so drift shows.
#   FPL_AGENT_EMAILS unset (local: commit-msg, pre-push)     .github/agent-emails.
#
# Each commit's own bytes are judged: git replace could put another commit's in their place.
