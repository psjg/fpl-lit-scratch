# .harness/scripts/new-worktree.sh — create an implementation worktree under worktrees/<name>/.
#
# The create recipe from .agents/WORKTREES.md as one command, usable by any agent or
# human (`.claude/commands/new-worktree.md` is a thin wrapper over this):
#
#   1. `git worktree add worktrees/<name> -b <branch> <base>`, always from the
#      root checkout, so it works when invoked from inside another worktree.
#      <branch> is attempt/<name>, or agent/<id>/attempt/<name> with -a: agent
#      commits are only accepted on agent branches (.agents/BRANCHES.md), so an
#      attempt an agent will work in needs -a.
#   2. Carries the root's agent identity into the new worktree. The file lives
#      under the per-worktree git dir, so a fresh worktree starts without one;
#      .agents/COMMITS.md fixes the email as one constant machine-account address,
#      so inheriting it is safe. Skipped when the root has none.
#   3. Runs `.harness/scripts/setup.sh` inside the new worktree (hooks, stacked-commit config,
#      identity report).
#
# It scaffolds nothing: an attempt's code and its `03-fpl/03.01-features/` are the first implementation
# session's job (.agents/CONVENTIONS.md).
#
# Usage:
#   .harness/scripts/new-worktree.sh [-n] [-a <id>] <name> [base]
#
#   <name>   [a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*  -> path worktrees/<name>, branch attempt/<name>
#   [base]   ref to branch from (default: main)
#   -a <id>  the agent that leads the attempt (claude, codex, …): the branch
#            becomes agent/<id>/attempt/<name>; the path stays worktrees/<name>
#   -n       dry run: print the commands, create nothing
