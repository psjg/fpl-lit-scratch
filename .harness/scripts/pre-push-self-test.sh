# .harness/scripts/pre-push-self-test.sh — proof that .githooks/pre-push holds every commit a push adds
# to the commit-msg gates, as the commit-lint workflow will on the pull request, and lets
# through what that workflow would pass. Run by `make gates`.
#
# commit-msg judges a commit's 'Stack:' trailer against the branch it is made on. A commit
# moved afterwards (cherry-pick, rebase --onto, branch -f) keeps the trailer of the branch
# it left, and only the forge noticed (fpl-org/fpl#125, #126). Every commit below is made
# with the hooks off, which is how such a commit looks to the push.
#
# Everything happens in a throwaway clone of this checkout's .githooks/, .harness/scripts/ and
# .github/, pushing to a bare repository on disk: forward-only does not judge a push that
# does not go to GitHub, and nothing reaches the network. Git's global and system config,
# HOME and XDG_CONFIG_HOME point away from the maintainer's. The leak gate is off: it has
# a self-test of its own, and the copied scripts hold its synthetic key.
#
# Where there is a /bin/bash, the whole run is made a second time with it first on PATH: on
# a Mac that is bash 3.2, which a push from outside the dev shell gets, and which every
# script the hook reaches must run under.
