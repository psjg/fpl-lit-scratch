#                                  commit, and with more than one commit the body also
#                                  lists every subject
#   .harness/scripts/pr.sh <branch>            that branch, without checking it out
#   .harness/scripts/pr.sh -t <title> -b <text>
#   .harness/scripts/pr.sh -B <base>           target that branch instead of the tail of the queue
#   .harness/scripts/pr.sh -n                  dry run: print what would be sent
#
# Open pull requests form one queue, first in, first out: each is based on the one filed
# before it, and only the head is based on main, so they merge one after another without
# conflicts between them (.agents/WORKFLOW.md). A new pull request goes on the tail: its base
# is the branch of the last open pull request, and the branch must already contain it.
# If it does not, this stops and says how to rebase onto it.
#
# Naming the branch matters when the checkout is someone's working copy: switching it to
# the branch rewrites their files, and a session that may not delete files can leave it
# half switched. Nothing below reads the working tree, only refs.
#
# Prints the URL of the pull request, and nothing else, on stdout. If the branch already
# has an open pull request, that one's URL is printed and nothing is created.
#
# The author of a pull request cannot approve it, so agent work is filed by the machine
# account and the maintainer reviews it (.agents/WORKFLOW.md). gh falls back to the active
# account without a word when a token lookup comes back empty, which would file the
# request as the maintainer and leave nobody to approve it. So this refuses unless the
# token belongs to the account named in .git/agent-identity, and unless the branch on the
# forge is the commit you have here. It does not push: a push is yours or the
# maintainer's to make (WORKFLOW.md, rule 8).
#
# It talks to the forge over its API, with python3 from the default dev shell, so the
# github layer is not needed. The token is gh's if gh has one for the machine account,
# else the one in .git/agent-credentials (.agents/WORKFLOW.md).
