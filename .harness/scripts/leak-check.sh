# .harness/scripts/leak-check.sh — keep private terms, and secrets, out of a public repository.
#
#   leak-check --staged          the staged change: its added lines and its file names
#   leak-check --message FILE    a commit message, as commit-msg is handed it
#   leak-check --range REVS      every commit REVS names: patches, file names, messages,
#                                author and committer. REVS is what git rev-list takes
#   leak-check --push URL        what a push sends, from pre-push's stdin (below)
#   leak-check --text FILE       free text: a pull request's title and body, ref names
#   leak-check --self-test       every mode against a synthetic list, in a temp repo
#
# The mechanism is public, the terms are not (Kerckhoffs). The terms live in private lists
# that are never committed, one per clone and one per maintainer, either or both absent:
#
#   $(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/leak-patterns
#   ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/fpl/leak-patterns
#
# One regular expression per line in Go's RE2 syntax (not POSIX: no \< or \>, use \b),
# matched case-insensitively, with ^ and $ at the ends of each line. A space in a line
# matches any run of whitespace, line breaks included, so a term that a 72-column wrap
# splits is still found; inside [...] it also admits '+', and an escaped space is not
# supported. Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are skipped, and so is whitespace
# around a line. Line n of the clone's list is rule leak-<n>, of the maintainer's
# leak-u<n>: gitleaks keys rules by id, so two lists cannot share one numbering. A list
# that exists but cannot be read stops the check; only a missing one is silent.
#
# gitleaks does the matching. It runs twice over the same input: once with a config that
# holds only the private rules, and once with its own default rules, which find real
# secrets (keys, tokens) with no list at all. Two runs, not one config extending the
# defaults, because the defaults carry a global allowlist (lock files, images, vendored
# code, gitleaks.toml) that would hide a private term in any of those files. Its escape
# hatches are shut: 'gitleaks:allow' comments are ignored, and so is any .gitleaksignore,
# since both would sit in the very tree being judged. Only added lines are judged, so
# removing a line never trips the check. A merge is judged by what it adds beyond the
# automatic merge (git's remerge diff), which is where an evil merge hides.
#
# gitleaks reads patches that git prints, so what git would hide is forced back in view:
# binary files and '-diff' attributes (--text), textconv and external diff drivers,
# colour from anyone's config, and replace refs, which push ignores.
# The staged change is judged as a throwaway commit of the index (write-tree and
# commit-tree, with a fixed identity and date, so the same index makes the same object;
# nothing points at it and gc drops it), because only a commit can be read with --text.
#
# --push URL reads pre-push's lines ("<local ref> <sha> <remote ref> <sha>"). An update
# to a branch the remote has is judged from the remote's commit. A branch new to the
# remote is judged by the commits no ref at URL has, as git ls-remote lists them at
# push time: not by remote-tracking refs, which a fetch may never have pruned, and not by
# another remote. A remote that cannot be listed, or holds none of them, gets the whole
# history judged.
# The names of the refs pushed and the text of annotated tags are judged too.
#
# Nothing it prints contains a term: gitleaks redacts what it matched, its own messages
# (which may quote a rule) are swallowed while a private list exists, and a file name that
# itself matches is reported by position, never by name. A report gives the rule, the list
# line it came from, and where: commit, file, line. The file is named from git's own
# listing, never from gitleaks's report: by position ("file 3 of 7") when the name matches
# a term or holds a control character (a tab, a newline), by name otherwise.
#
#   FPL_LEAK_GATE = block (default) | warn (report, don't refuse) | off
#
# Exit 0: nothing found (or warn/off). 1: something found, or the check could not run:
# gitleaks failed while a private list exists, or a step of its own failed (in warn mode
# too). With no list and no gitleaks it warns and passes: there is nothing private to
# protect, and the default rules are a bonus, not the point.
