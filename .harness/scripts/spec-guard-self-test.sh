# .harness/scripts/spec-guard-self-test.sh — proof that both halves of the oracle rule still bite where the
# maintainer's spec lives: the conformance suite 03-fpl/03.01-features/, and 02-docs/02.01-design.md and
# 02-docs/02.02-spec.md. Run by `make gates`.

#   .claude/hooks/guard-specs.sh   PreToolUse(Edit|Write), fed the JSON the harness sends:
#                                  an edit of a spec.md or of anything under examples/, as an
#                                  absolute or a relative path, and of the two docs, is refused
#                                  (exit 2, with its reason); any other path goes (exit 0), and
#                                  so does a spec path when the session has opted in with
#                                  FPL_SPEC_EDIT=1, the hook's designed exit
#   .githooks/commit-msg           gate 7: a commit that stages (or, in lint mode, holds) such a
#                                  path is refused without the marker [spec] in its message, and
#                                  goes with it; a commit of other paths needs no marker
#
# The run counts what it was asked and what it got; a refusal that never came, or a pass that
# should not have been, fails the test. Everything happens in a throwaway repository, with Git's
# global and system config, HOME and XDG_CONFIG_HOME pointed away from the maintainer's; the
# leak gate has a self-test of its own and is off here. Runs under any bash, 3.2 included.
