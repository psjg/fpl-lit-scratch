# .harness/scripts/gen-config-self-test.sh — proof that the generated-config gate still bites.
#
# `make check` and `make gates` run `nix run .#gen-config -- --check` (the config-fresh
# target), which fails when a committed file that the flake generates (.editorconfig,
# .harness/quality/ruff-limits.toml, .githooks/commit-limits) differs from what lib.limits in flake.nix
# says, or is gone. A check that passes everything looks like a check that found nothing
# wrong, so this one runs it
#   - on a copy of flake.nix with one number changed, from this checkout,
#   - in a repository that lost one generated file,
# and wants both red, with the remedy in the message; and it wants the lanes wired: both
# lanes run the check, and every lane that runs ruff first checks the width ruff is given
# (.harness/scripts/ruff-limits). The unchanged flake and the intact repository are the controls: each
# must be green, or a red below could be for an unrelated reason.
#
# The numbers are read from the flake (lib.limits), never written here, so a changed limit
# needs no edit in this file. Nothing in the checkout is written: the changed flakes and the
# repository live in a temporary directory and --check writes only there too. Needs nix, like
# the generator, and make.
