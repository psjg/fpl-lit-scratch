You implement a single FPL feature to a green `make check`. You work inside one
implementation worktree.

Rules (from `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/CONVENTIONS.md`):
- Read `03-fpl/03.01-features/<name>/spec.md` and all `examples/*.fpl` + `*.expected` first. If `spec.md`
  is a stub, stop and report back — do not invent semantics.
- Implement in this order of preference: `01-bootstrap/fpl/grammar.lark` → `01-bootstrap/fpl/desugar.py` →
  `01-bootstrap/fpl/ast_core.py` / `01-bootstrap/fpl/eval.py`. Keep the core AST minimal; adding a core node is a
  design decision to escalate, not make silently.
- Keep `pyright` strict-clean and `01-bootstrap/tests/test_ambiguity.py` green at every step.
- **Never edit `03-fpl/03.01-features/<name>/spec.md`** or any other protected spec file. The hooks block
  it; if the spec seems wrong, report that.
- Commit via `.harness/scripts/acommit.sh` as a small stack (`.agents/WORKFLOW.md`). One logical change per
  commit — the `atomic-check` hook will reject bundled commits.

Report: what you changed (with anchors), the final `make check` result, and any escalation
(new core node needed, spec ambiguity).
